<<<Project Overview>>>

"KAME Project" is a joint effort to create single solid software set,
especially targeted at IPv6/IPsec.  Talented researchers from Fujitsu
Limited, Hitachi, Ltd., IIJ Research Laboratory, NEC Corporation,
Toshiba Corporation, YDC Corporation and Yokogawa Electric Corporation
joined the project.  This joint effort will avoid unnecessary duplicated
development in the same area, and effectively provides high quality and
advanced featured packages.

KAME was originally called "Hydrangea" which was developed by v6
working group, WIDE Project.  We have merged codes, which each company
in Japan has developed, into "Hydrangea".  To identify the joint
effort, we changed the name from "Hydrangea" to "KAME".

Stabilized portion of KAME software has been merged into FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, and BSD/OS:
- FreeBSD: 4.0 and beyond
- NetBSD: 1.5 and beyond
- OpenBSD: 2.7 and beyond
- BSD/OS: 4.2 and beyond

"KAME" officially indicates a short word of <Ka>rigo<me> where our office
locates.  But it, in fact, stands for turtle in Japanese.


<<<Our Goals>>>

KAME Project aims to provide FREE reference implementations of
	(1) IPv6
	(2) IPsec
	(3) advanced internetworking such as advanced packet queuing, 
	    ATM, mobility, and whatever interesting
on several BSD variants.


<<<Copyright>>>

The kit comes with BSD-like copyright.  In short, the code is FREELY
available but with NO WARRANTY.  Even commercial use is OK.  Please
refer to the COPYRIGHT file for more details.  The copyright holder is
WIDE Project instead of KAME Project.  This is because KAME Project is
to be terminated in March 2002 (may be extended).

READ CAREFULLY: Several countries have legal enforcement for
export/import/use of cryptographic software.  Check it before playing
with the kit.


<<<What's Next?>>>

To know the difference from the previous stable release, please refer
to CHANGELOG and RELNOTES.

To install this kit, please read INSTALL at the top directory, and
INSTALL under operating system directory (for example,
netbsd/INSTALL).

If you want to know what features are provided, please refer to
IMPLEMENTATION. 

Before you start using this kit, please take a look at USAGE. 


<<<What is the difference with *BSD IPv6/IPsec code and KAME code?>>>

Starting summer 1999, *BSD distributions start incorporating KAME IPv6/IPsec
stack into their development track (i.e. *BSD-current).  Recently some of
*BSDs ship with integrated IPv6 code (for example, FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE).
Basically,
- *BSD distributions ship with past KAME code.  and they do not include
  some of experimental code in KAME tree (merger did not take place for
  some of experimental portion, on purpose).
- KAME kit includes more recent IPv6/IPsec changes by KAME team.
  It also includes more experimental code than the *BSD distributions, as
  well as additional functionalities which haven't integrated into *BSDs yet.

http://www.kame.net/project-overview.html#release talks more about this issue.
A file named COVERAGE has detailed comparison between kame/*bsd, *bsd-curernt
and recent *bsd releases.


<<<Reporting bugs>>

When you report bugs, please be sure to include the following information:
- the opertaing system platform you are using (like "FreeBSD 2.2.8-RELEASE")
- the hardware architecture you are using (i386, sparc, vax or whatever)
- the version of KAME you are using ("SNAP dated Jan 1 2000", or
  "grabbed via anonymous CVS around Jan 1 2000")
- information necessary to repeat the problem
  this includes, but not limited to,
	(1) kernel compilation options,
	(2) exact command line that raises the issue,
	(3) routing table setup taken by "netstat -rn",
	(4) interface configuration via "ifconfig -a",
	(5) sysctl setting taken by "sysctl -a"
- (if necessary) hardware configuration, like "ethernet card is NE2000"
- (if necessary) screen trace on the trouble, taken by "script" command.
- (if necessary) packet trace taken by "tcpdump" command.
- (if necessary) IPv6/v4 connectivity status in your network

Don't try to *describe* your settings, just paste command output itself
onto the report instead. A bad example is "I assigned a global address on
my ethernet interface, but ping6 didn't work. Why?" No one will be
able to answer this kind of question. Instead, you should type as follows:
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/ifconfig -a
(paste the output. Again, the exact output is best. Do not try to
 describe the output by your own word)
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/ifconfig ne0 inet6 2001:200::1234 prefixlen 64 alias
(paste the output)
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/ifconfig -a
(paste the output. The difference between the two "ifconfig -a" might
 be important.)
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/ping6 -n 2001:300::1
(paste the output, including errors and warnings)
etc...

If you track the bugs, please notice the following items:
- be sure to use "ping6 -n", not "ping6", when you probe reachability.
- read IMPLEMENTATION chapter 1.3 if you try link-local addresses on
  your tests.

Submit your bug report by using bug database, or you may want to
submit it to snap-users mailing list.
	bug database: http://www.kame.net/, or /usr/local/v6/bin/kame-send-pr
	snap-users mailing list: http://www.kame.net/snap-users/

Thanks for your feedback!
