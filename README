<<<Project Overview>>>

"KAME Project" is a joint effort to create single solid software set,
especially targeted at IPv6/IPsec.  Talented researchers from Fujitsu
Limited, Hitachi, Ltd., IIJ Research Laboratory, NEC Corporation,
Toshiba Corporation, Yokogawa Digital Computer Corporation, Yokogawa
Electric Corporation joined the project.  This joint effort will avoid
unnecessary duplicated development in the same area, and effectively
provides high quality and advanced featured package.

KAME is originally called "Hydrangea" which was developed by v6
working group, WIDE Project.  We are merging codes, which each company
in Japan has developed, into "Hydrangea".  To identify the joint
effort, we changed the name from "Hydrangea" to "KAME". 

KAME software has been merged into NetBSD-current.  It will also be
merged into BSD/OS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD(IPv6 stuff only).

"KAME" officially indicates a short word of <Ka>rigo<me> where our office
locates.  But it, in fact, stands for turtle in Japanese.

<<<Our Goals>>>

KAME Project aims to provide FREE reference implementations of
	(1) IPv6
	(2) IPsec
	(3) advanced internetworking such as advanced packet queuing, 
	    ATM, mobility, and whatever interesting
on several BSD variants.

<<<Copyright>>>

The kit comes with BSD-like copyright.  In short, the code is FREELY
available but with NO WARRANTY.  Even commercial use is OK.  Please
refer to the COPYRIGHT file for more details.  The copyright holder is
WIDE Project instead of KAME Project.  This is because KAME Project is
to be terminated in March 2000.

READ CAREFULLY: Several countries have legal enforcement for
export/import/use of cryptographic software.  Check it before playing
with the kit.
