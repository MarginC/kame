TODOs for KAME/OpenBSD

Things we can do with the current code:
- ip6 layer
	ip6 output, ip6 input
	"goto ours" hack needs to be revisited
- icmp6 layer
	replies to ping, DAD
- raw socket input/output

Things we can't do with the current code:
- some part of setsockopt()
	because of this, ping6 to multicast address is not able to send packets
	out.
- most of advapi
	because of this, ping6 cannot get the hoplimit value for incoming
	packet.
- multicast related items need checking
- connect() to IPv6 destination on tcp6 socket does not work (need checking)
- udp6 needs some more work
- "options IPSEC" does not even compile
	I was told that OpenBSD guys will never replace IPsec code.
	Since we use same symbol (#ifdef IPSEC) to control ipsec code,
	we need to wrap KAME shared ipsec code by "#ifndef __OpenBSD__".
