TODOs for KAME/OpenBSD
KAME project
$Id: TODO,v 1.4 1999/09/20 13:16:37 itojun Exp $


Things we can do with the current code:
- ip6 layer
	ip6 output, ip6 input
	"goto ours" hack needs to be revisited
- icmp6 layer
	replies to ping, DAD
- raw6 socket input/output
- tcp6 socket input/output (both daemon and client)
- udp6 socket input/output (need testing)

Things we can't do with the current code:
- some part of setsockopt()
	because of this, ping6 to multicast address is not able to send packets
	out.
- most of advapi
	because of this, ping6 cannot get the hoplimit value for incoming
	packet.
- multicast related items need checking
- "options IPSEC" does not even compile
	I was told that OpenBSD guys will never replace IPsec code.
	Since we use same symbol (#ifdef IPSEC) to control ipsec code,
	we need to wrap KAME shared ipsec code by "#ifndef __OpenBSD__".

Cleanup todo:
- move in6_select{src,hlim} out of kame/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c, put somewhere
  in kame/sys/netinet6/*.c, so that we can share the code among all the
  platforms
	(after kame/openbsd is stabilized enough)
- nuke unnecessary #ifdef NRL tcp/udp layer, for more readability
	(is it okay to do it?)
