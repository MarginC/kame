You'll need to follow the steps below.  They can be separated into two major
sections - kernel build and userland build.

Be sure to perform "tree preparation" procedure, described in
../INSTALL, prior to taking the steps below.


A. Backup
=========
The following procedure replaces, or overwrites, the following
files/directories:
	/bsd
	/usr/include
	some of boot-loader related files, such as those in /usr/mdec
so you may want to back them up before going through the steps.

A-1. Backup your kernel file, if you need to.
	# cp /bsd /bsd.previous

A-2. Backup /usr/include directory, if you want an untouched tree to be
   preserved somewhere.
	# cd /usr
	# mkdir include.clean
	# cd include.clean
	# (cd ../include; tar Bpcf - . ) | tar Bpxf -


B. Kernel build
===============
Consult OpenBSD documentations for more detail.

B-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/openbsd).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

B-1. Go down to sys/arch/ARCH/conf.
	% cd sys/arch/ARCH/conf

B-2. Make a kernel configuration file, and invoke "config CONFIGFILE".
     GENERIC.KAME should have commonly used IPv6 definitions, so you may want
     to copy the file to begin with.
	% /usr/sbin/config CONFIGFILE

B-3. Build the kernel.  The process will make kernel file named "netbsd".
	% cd ../compile/CONFIGFILE
	% make depend
	% make

B-4. Copy the kernel file to root directory, as root.
	# cp bsd /


C. Userland build
=================
C-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/openbsd).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

C-1. Invoke "make includes" as root.  This will populate KAME-ready include
     files into /usr/include.
	# make includes

C-2. As normal user (or root, if you prefer) perform "make".
	% make

C-3. As root, perform "make install".  This will install necessary userland
     tools into /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin,whatever}.  This should not replace
     existing IPv4-only userland tools, so it is safe.
	# make install


D. Reboot
=========
D-1. Reboot with the command you like.
	# reboot


E. Configurations, in short
===========================
E-1. Most of configuration files are placed in /usr/local/v6/etc.
     You may want to copy those foo.sample files into non-sample (foo),
     edit as necessary.  You may also want to invoke /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6
     from /etc/rc.local, by adding the following into /etc/rc.local:
	if [ -f /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6 ]; then
		sh /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6
	fi

E-2. If you would like to use IPv6-ready inetd, you will need to stop using
     /usr/sbin/inetd and switch to /usr/local/v6/sbin/inetd.
     To do this, please replace the following section in /etc/rc:

>if [ X${inetd} = X"YES" ]; then
>	echo -n ' inetd';		inetd
>fi

     into this:

>if [ X${inetd} = X"YES" ]; then
>	echo -n ' inetd'
>	if [ -x /usr/local/v6/sbin/inetd ]; then
>		/usr/local/v6/sbin/inetd
>	else
>		inetd
>	fi
>fi

     Configuration file is placed in /etc/inetd.conf, but with enhanced syntax
     (it is backward compatible so do not be afraid).  Consult manpages
     for details.  You only need add lines for IPv6-ready daemons with "tcp6"
     or "udp6", like below:
>ftp	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	/usr/local/v6/libexec/ftpd	ftpd -l

E-3. If you wish to use ALTQ, you may need to invoke /dev/MAKEDEV.altq.
	# cd /dev
	# sh MAKEDEV.altq all

E-4. Commands modified by KAME project are placed in /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin}.
     For daily use, you will need to add both of (or either of) them
     into your command search path (consult manpage for your favorite
     shell).  Make sure to make them used before /usr/bin or /usr/sbin,
     otherwise you end up using OS-supplied (hence not IPv6 nor IPsec capable)
     commands.

E-5. There are batch of documents installed into /usr/local/v6/man
     and /usr/local/v6/share/doc.  Please read them as necessary.
     If you wish to develop your own programs, we suggest you to read through
     supplied documents, RFCs, and other documents to learn how.
