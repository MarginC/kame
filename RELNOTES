For list of changes from past KAME kit, please refer to CHANGELOG.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTICE
=============================
Please understand that the KAME kit is, from its nature, a
distribution of very experimental set of software.  Do not assume ANY
backward copmatibility, for source, binary nor configuration file,
between different version of KAME kits.  This means that you MUST
recompile everything every time you upgrade KAME kit, to ensure it
works.  We are not ignoring backward compatibility issues, however, we
are sometimes unable to maintain backward compatibility.

The caveat does not apply to KAME code merged into *BSD - merged code
will maintain the backward compatibility policy decided by *BSD team.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
Most of the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP
releases, and the next STABLE release,

You can find problem reports from other KAME users, at:
	http://orange.kame.net/dev/query-pr-summary.cgi
Many of old ones have been solved.

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.
  Some part of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may
  fail to propagate screen size information to the peer.

- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure
  more than 500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there
  are some places where max # of interfaces is hardcoded) Also, some
  of non-KAME binaries may not be ready to handle tons of interfaces.
  If a code uses fixed-size buffer for SIOCGIFCONF, the code is not
  friendly with tons-of-interface kernel.

- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet
  card will not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session,
  and this makes trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses
  multicast).  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problems), but please
  be warned.  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up"
  after resume.

- Intel EtherExpress Pro (fxp driver) has some problem with the
  initialization sequence KAME is using (a set of ioctl calls).  The
  driver will become unusable if consequtive calls to fxp_init() are
  made, or consequtive multicast configurations are made.  This
  problem occurs only with specific revision of the card, and with
  specific operating system platform (openbsd, and maybe freebsd[23]).
  It is not KAME problem, it is problem in fxp driver.  KAME/OpenBSD
  contains workaround for this.  KAME/NetBSD has no problem due to the
  way driver initializes the card.

- Alignment constraints were changed in couple of places.  Namely: 
	(1) SIOCGIFCONF: due to introduction of sockaddr_in6. 
	(2) ancillary data: due to RFC2292 and X/Open change in CMSG_xx.  
  You may experience some trouble running non-KAME binaries (like
  those shipped with stock *BSD) on top of KAME kernel.

- With KAME/NetBSD, ipip pseudo interface does not work at all.

- In the past we have shipped IPv6-ready tcpdump/libpcap with KAME
  kit.  To make a single effort in tcpdump.org, we have removed the
  compilation tree (*bsd*/usr.sbin/tcpdump and *bsd*/lib/libpcap).  If
  you want IPv6-ready tcpdump/libpcap, download them from tcpdump.org.
  We supply ports/pkgsrc for easier installation on kame/freebsd[23]
  and kame/netbsd.
