For list of changes from past KAME kit, please refer to CHANGELOG.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
All the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP releases,
and the next STABLE release,

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.  Some part
  of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may fail to propagate
  screen size information to the peer.
- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure more than
  500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there are some places
  where max # of interfaces is hardcoded)
  Also, some of non-KAME binaries may not be ready to handle tons of
  interfaces.  If a code uses fixed-size buffer for SIOCGIFCONF, the code
  is not friendly with tons-of-interface kernel.
- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet card will
  not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session, and this makes
  trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses multicast).
  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problem), but please be warned.
  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up" after resume.
- Intel EtherExpress Pro (fxp driver) has some problem with the
  initialization sequence KAME is using (a set of ioctl calls).  The driver
  will become unusable if consequtive calls to fxp_init() are made, or
  consequtive multicast configurations are made.
  This problem occurs only with specific revision of the card, and with
  specific operating system platform (openbsd, and maybe freebsd[23]).
  It is not KAME problem, it is problem in fxp driver.
  KAME/OpenBSD contains workaround for this.

PLATFORM DIFFERENCES
====================
As we support various platforms, there are several differences between
those platforms.  Here is a brief list of important differences.
We hope to improve support coverage sooner.

Look at a document named COVERAGE for details.
