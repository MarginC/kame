For list of changes from past KAME kit, please refer to CHANGELOG.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTICE
=============================
Please understand that the KAME kit is, from its nature, a distribution
of very experimental set of software.  Do not assume ANY backward
copmatibility, for source, binary nor configuration file, between
different version of KAME kits, or between KAME-patched tree and
normal *BSD tree.  This means that you MUST recompile everything
every time you upgrade KAME kit, to ensure it works.  You may also
need to update your configuration files to meet the latest
implementation.  We are not ignoring backward compatibility issues,
however, we are sometimes unable to maintain backward compatibility.

For this reason, the following act can raise troubles like kernel panic,
abnormal program termination and other things:
- try to make shared library from KAME-supplied library and override
  normal ones
- mix LKM binary and kernel binary from different origin
  (like FreeBSD-origin LKM binary and KAME kernel)
- mix dynamic linked modules for non-IPv6 ready program, with IPv6-ready
  parent program (like non-IPv6 apache modules and IPv6-ready apache)
- mix non-KAME userland binary with KAME kernel.  it depends on what kind of
  kernel API the binary uses.
  Example: *BSD-origin netstat will not work with KAME kernel, as it touches
	kmem and we changed the size of inpcb between *BSD and KAME kernel.
  Example: FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE uses spec non-conformant numbers for PF_KEY
	API (sys/net/pfkeyv2.h).  KAME/freebsd4 uses spec-conformant numbers,
	so freeBSD 4.2-RELEASE setkey(8) will choke on KAME/freebsd4 kernel
	(and vice versa).

The caveat does not apply to KAME code merged into *BSD - merged code
will maintain the backward compatibility policy decided by *BSD team.

SECURITY FIXES
==============
Note that the KAME tree MAY NOT include all the security fixes from
*BSD, or some other advisories.  So, some portion of KAME code may
be vulnerable to attacks.  If you run KAME code on production system,
real-world routers and other realworld use, you may want to check *BSD
advisories and other announcements.

Please let developers know if you notice significant issues.

END OF LIFE
===========
We do not maintain KAME kits for older releases on a release branch -
for example, on FreeBSD 4.x series, KAME kit is supplied and maintained for
the latest one only (4.2-RELEASE as of this writing).

KAME/FreeBSD 3.5 (or 3.x series) has reached its end of life.  We supply it for
reference purposes only.  The tree may not compile at all.
Use newer BSD official releases, or KAME kit on more recent BSD releases.

KAME/FreeBSD 2.2.8 (or 2.2.x series) is not actively maintained well any more
- for instance, freebsd2/ports contains very obsolete set of software, some of
functionalities may not compile, security holes may be still there, and such.
For more recent functionalities use newer BSD official releases, or KAME kit
on more recent BSD releases.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
Most of the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP releases.

You can find problem reports from other KAME users, at:
	http://orange.kame.net/dev/query-pr-summary.cgi
Many of old ones have been solved.

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.
  Some part of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may
  fail to propagate screen size information to the peer.
  (You should not use rsh/rlogin over tcp relay, anyways, for security reasons)

- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure
  more than 500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there
  are some places where max # of interfaces is hardcoded) Also, some
  of non-KAME binaries may not be ready to handle tons of interfaces.
  If a code uses fixed-size buffer for SIOCGIFCONF, the code is not
  friendly with tons-of-interface kernel.

- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet
  card will not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session,
  and this makes trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses
  multicast).  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problems), but please
  be warned.  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up"
  after resume.

- FreeBSD/OpenBSD/BSDI Intel EtherExpress Pro driver has some problem with
  the initialization sequence KAME is using.  This is because these
  drivers use interrupts for multicast filter setup, and KAME code calls
  multicast initialization code in splimp() or splnet(). 
  It is not KAME problem, it is problem in drivers.  These drivers should
  be corrected not to use interropts in initialization sequence.

  KAME/FreeBSD: fxp driver, no workaround available.
  KAME/OpenBSD: fxp driver, workaround is in KAME tree (sys/net/if.c)
  KAME/BSDI3: exp driver, status unknown
  KAME/BSDI4: exp driver, workaround is in KAME tree (sys/i386/pci/if_exp.c)

- Alignment constraints were changed in couple of places.  Namely: 
	(1) SIOCGIFCONF: due to introduction of sockaddr_in6. 
	(2) ancillary data: due to RFC2292 and X/Open change in CMSG_xx.  
  You may experience some trouble running non-KAME binaries (like
  those shipped with stock *BSD) on top of KAME kernel.

- In the past we have shipped IPv6-ready tcpdump/libpcap with KAME
  kit.  To make a single effort in tcpdump.org, we have removed the
  compilation tree (*bsd*/usr.sbin/tcpdump and *bsd*/lib/libpcap).  If
  you want IPv6-ready tcpdump/libpcap, download them from tcpdump.org.
  We supply ports/pkgsrc for easier installation on kame/freebsd[23]
  and kame/netbsd.

- libinet6 resolver code does not support NIS lookup.

- bsdi4: may see panics on multicast socket close.
