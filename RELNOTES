For list of changes from past KAME kit, please refer to CHANGELOG.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTICE
=============================
Please understand that the KAME kit is, from its nature, a distribution of
very experimental set of software.  Do not assume ANY backward copmatibility,
for source, binary nor configuration file, between different version of
KAME kits.  This means that, to make sure code works, you MUST recompile
everything every time you upgrade KAME kit.  We are not ignoring backward
compatibility issues, however, we do not necessarily provide it.

The caveat does not apply to KAME code merged into *BSD - merged code will
obey the backward compatibility policy decided by *BSD team.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
All the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP releases,
and the next STABLE release,

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.  Some part
  of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may fail to propagate
  screen size information to the peer.
- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure more than
  500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there are some places
  where max # of interfaces is hardcoded)
  Also, some of non-KAME binaries may not be ready to handle tons of
  interfaces.  If a code uses fixed-size buffer for SIOCGIFCONF, the code
  is not friendly with tons-of-interface kernel.
- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet card will
  not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session, and this makes
  trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses multicast).
  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problem), but please be warned.
  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up" after resume.
- Intel EtherExpress Pro (fxp driver) has some problem with the
  initialization sequence KAME is using (a set of ioctl calls).  The driver
  will become unusable if consequtive calls to fxp_init() are made, or
  consequtive multicast configurations are made.
  This problem occurs only with specific revision of the card, and with
  specific operating system platform (openbsd, and maybe freebsd[23]).
  It is not KAME problem, it is problem in fxp driver.
  KAME/OpenBSD contains workaround for this.

PLATFORM DIFFERENCES
====================
As we support various platforms, there are several differences between
those platforms.  Here is a brief list of important differences.
We hope to improve support coverage sooner.

Look at a document named COVERAGE for details.
