For list of changes from past KAME kit, please refer to CHANGELOG.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
All the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP releases,
and the next STABLE release,

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.  Some part
  of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may fail to propagate
  screen size information to the peer.
- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure more than
  500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there are some places
  where max # of interfaces is hardcoded)
- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet card will
  not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session, and this makes
  trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses multicast).
  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problem), but please be warned.
  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up" after resume.
- racoon daemon does not work correctly due to code synchronization problem
  between userland and the kernel (racoon daemon compiles fine but will not
  be able to negotiate keys).  Because of STABLE cut-off date we were
  unable to fix this.  If you would like to use racoon, please use more
  recent SNAP kit instead.
- freebsd[23]/usr.bin/fetch does not properly handle IPv6 passive mode (EPSV).
- When IPsec header is present, TCP MSS computation violates specification
  (no interoperability nor performance problem is experienced, though).
- fxp interface may not work due to some timing conflict with DAD procedure
  on freebsd3 machine.
  Currently, following workaround is known.
   -rewrite sys/pci/if_fxp.c like FreeBSD228 based one, or,
   -add /etc/start_if.fxpX for each of fxp0, fxp1... and do following in
    those files,
     ifconfig fxpX up 
- IPv6 interface identifier generator is revisited.  The logic became more
  strict about the use of "u" bit in IEEE802/EUI64.  If you upgrade from past
  STABLE kit, you may experience change in interface identifier, and change
  in your IPv6 link-local/global addresses.
- on freebsd3, traceroute6 may not work properly due to IPsec policy
  handling issues.

PLATFORM DIFFERENCES
====================
As we support various platforms, there are several differences between
those platforms.  Here is a brief list of important differences:
- ALTQ
	ALTQ 1.2 is merged into:	KAME/FreeBSD228, KAME/FreeBSD32
	No ALTQ support in:		KAME/BSDI31, KAME/NetBSD141
- TCP
	see IMPLEMENTATION for details.
