Here is a summary of differences between KAME STABLE 19990809 and STABLE
199910xx.

KNOWN BUGS/TWISTS
=================
All the following problems will be fixed in near-future SNAP releases,
and the next STABLE release,

- "faithd" sometimes fail to relay rsh/rlogin connection properly.  Some part
  of data connection seems to be lost.  rlogin session may fail to propagate
  screen size information to the peer.
- Some of the userland tool may not work properly, if you configure more than
  500 interfaces.  (libinet6 is fixed for this, but there are some places
  where max # of interfaces is hardcoded)
- Notebooks/laptops problem: multicast hardware filter on ethernet card will
  not be properly initialized after suspend/resume session, and this makes
  trouble with IPv6 commuincation (which heavily uses multicast).
  This is not a KAME problem (*BSD problem), but please be warned.
  Workaround: perform "ifconfig down", then "ifconfig up" after resume.
- racoon daemon may not work correctly due to code synchronization problem
  between userland and the kernel.  Because of STABLE cut-off date we do not
  supply fixes for this.  If you would like to use racoon, please use more
  recent SNAP kit instead.

PLATFORM DIFFERENCES
====================
As we support various platforms, there are several differences between
those platforms.  Here is a brief list of important differences:
- ALTQ
	ALTQ 1.2 is merged into:	KAME/FreeBSD228, KAME/FreeBSD32
	No ALTQ support in:		KAME/BSDI31, KAME/NetBSD141
- TCP
	see kit/IMPLEMENTATION for details.
