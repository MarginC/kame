InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading is handled
by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each client.  Both innd
and nnrpd have some slight variances from the NNTP protocol.

This port includes IPv6 support by NORTH 6bone project. See
