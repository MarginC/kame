Installation procedure - preparation of the tree

KAME build tree shares part of the tree among operating system
platforms.  "kame" directory is shared among "netbsd", "freebsd2",
and other platforms.  You'll first need to make a complete tree from
distributed tree.

1. Identify your target operating system, by looking at document named
   "VERSION".  Suppose the target is "netbsd".

2. Be sure to have complete tree under your target directory ("netbsd").
   In some cases you'll need to bring in vanilla distribution into
   subdirectories and perform "patch" operation.  Consult target directory-
   dependent document for details.

3. Invoke the following:
	% make TARGET=netbsd prepare
   This will create necessary symbolic links for the build (from TARGET
   tree to "kame" tree).
   NOTE: You'll need perl interpreter for invoking this.

4. Some part of the tree works better if you have installed third-party
   libraries.  Namely:
	usr.sbin/tcpdump:
		SSLeay or OpenSSL will let you look inside IPsec packet.
	usr.bin/racoon:
		Compiles only if SSLeay or OpenSSL is installed beforehand.
   Please install those libraries, preferrably with *BSD ports/packages.

5. Go down to the target operating system you have specified, and read
   document named "INSTALL".  Good luck!
