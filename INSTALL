KAME build tree shares part of the tree among operating system
platforms.  "kame" directory is shared among "netbsd", "freebsd2",
and other platforms.  You'll first need to make a complete tree from
distributed tree.

1. Identify your target operating system, by looking at document named
   "VERSION".  Suppose the target is "netbsd".

2. Be sure to have complete tree under your target directory ("netbsd").
   In some cases you'll need to bring in vanilla distribution into
   subdirectories and perform "patch" operation.  Consult target directory-
   dependent document for details.

3. Invoke the following:
	% make TARGET=netbsd prepare
   This will create necessary symbolic links for the build (from TARGET
   tree to "kame" tree).
   NOTE: You'll need perl interpreter for invoking this.

4. Go down to the target operating system you have specified, and read
   document named "INSTALL".  Good luck!
