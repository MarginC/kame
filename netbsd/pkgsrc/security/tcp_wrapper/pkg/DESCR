With this package you can monitor and filter incoming requests for the
SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, RSH, EXEC, TFTP, TALK, and other
network services.

The package provides tiny daemon wrapper programs that can be installed
without any changes to existing software or to existing configuration
files.  The wrappers report the name of the client host and of the
requested service; the wrappers do not exchange information with the
client or server applications, and impose no overhead on the actual
conversation between the client and server applications.

Optional features are: access control to restrict what systems can
connect to what network daemons; client user name lookups with the RFC
931 etc. protocol; additional protection against hosts that pretend to
have someone elses host name; additional protection against hosts that
pretend to have someone elses host address.


This port supports IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and IPv4 mapped IPv6 address.
You can replace stock tcpd or libwrap.a with this.
Field separater is changed from `:' to `|' because of confliction with
notation of IPv6 address.  Separater for option field is still `:'.
IPv6 address pattern is as a `net/prefixlen' pair.
This port was tested on KAME/FreeBSD and KAME/FreeBSD3.
