What is Heimdal?
================

Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5. The goals are to:

   * have an implementation that can be freely used outside of the
     United States
   * be protocol compatible with existing implementations and, if not in
     conflict, with RFC 1510 (and any future updated RFC)
   * be somewhat compatible with the M.I.T. Kerberos V5 API
   * have support for Kerberos V5 over GSS-API (RFC1964)
   * include the most important and useful application programs (rsh,
     telnet, popper, etc.)
   * include enough backwards compatibility with Kerberos V4

This initial pre-version is mostly compatible with the M.I.T.
implementation, as well as DCE secd. The library is at least not
completely different from the M.I.T. `libkrb5'.
