You'll need to follow the steps below.  They can be separated into two major
sections - kernel build and userland build.

Be sure to perform "tree preparation" procedure, described in
../INSTALL.prepare, prior to taking the steps below.


A. Backup
=========
The following procedure replaces, or overwrites, the following
files/directories:
	/netbsd
	/usr/include
	some of boot-loader related files, such as those in /usr/mdec
so you may want to back them up before going through the steps.

A-1. Backup your kernel file, if you need to.
	# cp /netbsd /netbsd.previous

A-2. Backup /usr/include directory, if you want an untouched tree to be
   preserved somewhere.
	# cd /usr
	# mkdir include.clean
	# cd include.clean
	# (cd ../include; tar Bpcf - . ) | tar Bpxf -


B. Kernel build
===============
Consult NetBSD documentations for more detail.

B-1. Go down to sys/arch/ARCH/conf.
	% cd sys/arch/ARCH/conf

B-2. Make a kernel configuration file, and type "config CONFIGFILE".
     GENERIC.v6 should have commonly used IPv6 definitions, so you may want to
     copy the file to begin with.
	% config CONFIGFILE

B-3. Build the kernel.  The process will make kernel file named "netbsd".
	% cd ../../compile/CONFIGFILE
	% make depend
	% make

B-4. Copy the kernel file to root directory, as root.
	# cp netbsd /


C. Userland build
=================
C-1. Invoke "make includes" as root.  This will populate KAME-ready include
     files into /usr/include.
	# make includes

C-2. As normal user (or root, if you prefer) perform "make".
	% make

C-3. As root, perform "make install".  This will install necessary userland
     tools into /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin,whatever}.  This should not replace
     existing IPv4-only userland tools, so it is safe.
	# make install


D. Reboot
=========
D-1. Reboot with the command you like.
	# fastboot
