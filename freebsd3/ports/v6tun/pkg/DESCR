      v6tun --- ipv6 tunneling tool

* What is v6tun?

   v6tun is an ipv6 tunneling tool using tun device. You can get ipv6
   reachability using an application level tunneling when you are in
   ipv6 lonely island on ipv4 world.

   Usage is "v6tun <v6addr> [<cmd> <arg> ...]". To connect to a remote
   router and authenticate the connection, you can use <cmd> and <arg>s.

                 local host side ||     || remote router side (on 6Bone)
    /dev/tun0 <-> v6tun <-> <cmd> <-----> <daemon?> <-> v6tun <-> /dev/tun0

   v6tun in the local side executes "<command> <arg> ... v6tun <v6addr>"
   and executing "v6tun <v6addr>" in the remote side is expected.
