mMosaic is a derivative work of NCSA XMosaic 2.7b4. You can use it as
a simple browser. 'Multithread-like' browsing is enable:
Simultaneously browsing in multiple window and/or download. This is
the major works since the last.  Cache was revisited.

All thoses goodies would like to be multicasted. This is the real
target of mMosaic (else why call it m-Mosaic?). mMosaic is possibly a
good companion for the Whiteboard.
