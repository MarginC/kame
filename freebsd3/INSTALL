You'll need to follow the steps below.  They can be separated into two major
sections - kernel build and userland build.

Be sure to perform "tree preparation" procedure, described in
../INSTALL, prior to taking the steps below.


A. Backup
=========
The following procedure replaces, or overwrites, the following
files/directories:
	/kernel
	/usr/include
so you may want to back them up before going through the steps.

A-1. Backup your kernel file, if you need to.
	# cp /kernel /kernel.previous

A-2. Backup /usr/include directory, if you want an untouched tree to be
   preserved somewhere.
	# cd /usr
	# mkdir include.clean
	# cd include.clean
	# (cd ../include; tar Bpcf - . ) | tar Bpxf -


B. Kernel build
===============
Consult FreeBSD documentations for more detail.

B-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/freebsd3).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

B-1. Go down to sys/i386/conf.
	% cd sys/i386/conf

B-2. Make a kernel configuration file, and invoke "/usr/sbin/config CONFIGFILE".
     GENERIC.v6 should have commonly used IPv6 definitions, so you may want to
     copy the file to begin with.
	% cp GENERIC.v6 CONFIGFILE
	% vi CONFIGFILE
	% /usr/sbin/config CONFIGFILE

B-3. Build the kernel.  The process will make kernel file named "kernel".
	% cd ../../compile/CONFIGFILE
	% make depend
	% make

B-4. Install the kernel file to root directory, as root.
	# make install


C. Userland build
=================
C-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/freebsd3).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

C-1. Invoke "make includes" as normal user, then "make install-includes"
     as root.  This will populate KAME-ready include files into /usr/include.
	% make includes
	# make install-includes

C-2. As normal user (or root, if you prefer) perform "make".
	% make

C-3. As root, perform "make install".  This will install necessary userland
     tools into /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin,whatever}.  This should not replace
     existing IPv4-only userland tools, so it is safe.
	# make install


D. Reboot
=========
D-1. Reboot with the command you like.
	# fastboot


E. Configurations, in short
===========================
E-1. Most of configuration files are placed in /usr/local/v6/etc.
     You may want to copy those foo.sample files into non-sample (foo),
     edit as necessary.  You may also want to invoke /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6
     from /etc/rc.local, by adding the following into /etc/rc.local:
	if [ -f /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6 ]; then
		sh /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6
	fi

E-2. If you would like to use IPv6-ready inetd, you will need to also invoke
     /usr/local/v6/sbin/inet46d.
     It can coexist with original /usr/sbin/inetd, but when both of them are
     invoked, IPv4 connection accept is always treated by /usr/sbin/inetd.
     When only /usr/local/v6/sbin/inet46d is invoked, it accepts each of
     IPv4 and IPv6 connection request.
     Configuration file is placed in /usr/local/v6/etc/inet6d.conf, but with
     enhanced syntax. Inet46d accepts either of IPv4 and IPv6 connection by 
     default, but you can configure it to accept only one of those protocols
     by each daemon basis. Consult manpages for details.

E-3. If you wish to use ALTQ, you may need to invoke /dev/MAKEDEV.altq.
	# cd /dev
	# sh MAKEDEV.altq all

E-4. Commands modified by KAME project are placed in /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin}.
     For daily use, you will need to add both of (or either of) them
     into your command search path (consult manpage for your favorite
     shell).  Make sure to make them used before /usr/bin or /usr/sbin,
     otherwise you end up using OS-supplied (hence not IPv6 nor IPsec capable)
     commands.

E-5. There are batch of documents installed into /usr/local/v6/man
     and /usr/local/v6/share/doc.  Please read them as necessary.
     If you wish to develop your own programs, we suggest you to read through
     supplied documents, RFCs, and other documents to learn how.

F. PAO3 issues
=============
Many of FreeBSD3.x users install PAO3 PCMCIA support code.  If you would like
to use both PAO3 and KAME, you'll need to apply PAO3 patches onto KAME tree.
