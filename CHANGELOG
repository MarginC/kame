<200101>
2001-01-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/etc/rc.net6: prohibit the prefix command by default.
	Since the command has recently caused many problems, we should
	reconsider the prefix management mechanism.

Fri Jan  5 22:51:16 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* libinet6/name6.c: nuke getnodeby{name,addr}, which was mentioned
	  only in draft-ietf-ipngwg-bsd-api-new-01.txt.

Fri Jan  5 13:24:21 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* getaddrinfo.c (shared/netbsd/openbsd/freebsd4)
	  query DNS only once per an AF.

2001-01-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib/irs/gethostent.c: allowed gethostbyname
	to accept abbreviated IPv4 text addresses (like 127.1).
	(XXX: this change is against a bind8 policy, but just for backward
	compatibility.)

2001-01-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/lib/libinet6/Makefile: do not link resolver files when
	USE_LIBBIND6 is YES, so that enhanced libbind could be tested.
	* freebsd3/*/Makefile.inc: when USE_LIBBIND6 is YES, link libbind
	(as well as libinet6).

Tue Jan  2 17:15:44 JST 2001  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/in6{,_ifattach}.c: correct use of IFAREF/IFFREE on
	  non-netbsd operating systems.  old code had memory leak possibility
	  on SIOCDIFADDR_IN6.  reported by hitachi guys.

2001-01-01  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi4/lib/libinet6:
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib:
	massive improvements on DNS resolver including
	- IPv6 transport of DNS resolver. An IPv6 textual address can now
	  be in the /etc/resolv.conf file as a DNS server.
	- support of A6 and DNAME with bit string labels. They are still
	  very experimental, and thus disabled by default. "options a6"
	  and "options dname" in the /etc/resolv.conf file would enable A6
	  and DNAME, respectively.
	- EDNS0 OPT RR support with UDP buffer size negotiation. which is
	  disabled by default, and would enabled by "options edns0" in the
	  /etc/resolv.conf file.
	- clarification on the relationship between address family and irs
	  functions. For example, if you call getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC,
	  and irs.conf specifies to consider the local hosts file first,
	  then getaddrinfo would try to resolve an address in the
	  following order:
	  + IPv6 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv4 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv6 addresses via DNS.
	  + IPv4 addresses via DNS.
	  And, if one of the first two attempts succeeded, the remaining
	  two methods would be skipped. This change of the behavior would
	  be useful if you put both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in the hosts
	  file, and do not want to see redundant DNS packets.
