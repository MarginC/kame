<200001>
Wed Jan 26 06:12:38 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/irssi: upgrade to 0.7.23.

Wed Jan 26 03:33:41 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* {netbsd/pkgsrc/net,freebsd[23]/ports}/{libpcap,tcpdump}:
	  famous packet capturing tool, from tcpdump.org codebase.  it
	  contains identical code as kame/{libpcap,tcpdump} so we plan
	  to avoid duplicate maintenance (put all libpcap/tcpdump
	  efforts into tcpdump.org).

Tue Jan 25 20:30:32 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ipcomp_core.c: don't attach Adler32 checksum
	  to compressed data.  see ipsec wg mailing list (Jan 2000) for
	  details.

Tue Jan 25 17:21:15 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/rcmd.c: make rcmd() behavior to IPv4-only, for safety
	  (see 2292bis for reasons).  implement rcmd_af().
	  KAME-supplied rlogin(1) and rsh(1) may not work right due to the
	  change.

Mon Jan 24 23:37:38 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/net/ethereal: upgrade to 0.8.1.

Mon Jan 24 17:28:25 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/net/fetchmail: upgrade to 5.2.4.

Mon Jan 24 12:49:34 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/irssi: new port: irssi-0.7.22, GTK based irc
	  client.

Sun Jan 23 13:24:00 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: remove #ifdef FAITH (and use of
	  environment varaible GAI).  this has been broken for a long time
	  (means noone is using it), and this shouldn't be here.
	  if you would like to set FAITH'ed prefix, use totd or /etc/hosts.

2000-01-22  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (ip6_reset_rcvopt): fixed a bug
	that a freed pointer could not be re-initialized, which might
	cause kernel panic.

Sat Jan 22 02:01:57 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/lftp: new port: lftp-2.1.6, ftp client.

Fri Jan 21 21:17:35 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/net/irc: upgrade to 2.10.3, make it buildable again.

Fri Jan 21 12:59:51 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net

	  freebsd[23]/ports/totd: upgrade to 1.1p2.
	  From: Feico Dillema

Thu Jan 20 18:41:40 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/lang/python, freebsd[23]/ports/python:
	  upgrade to latest IPv6 patch.

Wed Jan 19 22:04:22 2000 kjc@csl.sony.co.jp
	remove ECN support from TCP in freebsd3.
	it was removed in altq-2.0 and provided as a separate patch.

Wed Jan 19 21:47:19 2000 kjc@csl.sony.co.jp
	add atm pvc support tools included in the altq release.
	- pvcsif:    create pvc sub-interface
	- pvctxctl:  set vpi:vci and shaper
	- pvcbridge: set pvc bridge mode

Wed Jan 19 20:35:42 2000  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* NAT-PT translator and its command become compilable on
	  freebsd2, freebsd3, netbsd, and bsdos3.

Wed Jan 19 06:44:02 JST 2000 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	  improved the way to define a certificate type.
	  If signature method as `authentication method' is defined,
	  `identifier' is defined subjectname.
	  `certificate_type' is defined certificate type.
	  XXX why isn't certificate type negotiated in IKE ?

Wed Jan 19 05:15:50 JST 2000 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/kame/racoon:
	ignore certificate request, not error.  Should be handled.

Wed Jan 19 02:39:23 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/usr.sbin/lpd: IPv6 and multiple listening socket support.
	  NetBSD PR 9050 from Feico Dillema.

Wed Jan 19 00:15:50 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/bindresvport.c: bring in bindresvport_af() from
	  openbsd-current.  the function signature and behavior is under
	  debate in ipngwg mailing list, so I thought it would be good to
	  bring it in and try using it, to see any pros/cons we might have
	  in particular proposal (and other proposals).
	  (available in netbsd, openbsd, freebsd2 and freebsd3)

Tue Jan 18 22:48:35 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/rresvport_af.c: preserve old rresvport() behavior.
	  it needs to honor parameter (*port) if given.  previous behavior
	  was broken.
	  From: Markus Friedl <Markus.Friedl@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

Tue Jan 18 16:30:05 JST 2000 kjc@csl.sony.co.jp
	update ALTQ from 2.0 to 2.1.
	this version supports openbsd in addition to freebsd2, freebsd3
	and netbsd.
	kernel:
	- altq related files are moved from "sys/net" and "sys/netinet"
	  to "sys/altq" not to bloat the standard directories.
	- rename the altq kernel config file from ALTQ to ALTQ.v4 since
	  it's only for IPv4 and GENERIC.v6 has ALTQ already defined.
	  for openbsd/netbsd, on non-i386 architecture: read IMPLEMENTATION
	  section 5 for installation details.
	userland:
	- the following altq tools are added to the tree:
	  lib/altqlib, usr.sbin/altqd, user.bin/altqstat.
	- install MAKEDEV.altq to /dev.

	NOTE: be sure to cleanup old symlinks, by "make TARGET=netbsd clean",
	in the top directory.

2000-01-18  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.h: changed the type of the
	icmp6_n[il]_nonece member of the icmp6_{namelookup, nodeinfo}
	structures from u_int64_t to u_int8_t[8] in order to avoid
	possible alignment problems.
	From: Ryota HIROSE <hirose@comm.yamaha.co.jp>

Tue Jan 18 13:57:28 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* freebsd3/sys/netinet6/udp6_usrreq.c: fix panic on udp6_ctlinput.
	  from: ume@mahoroba.org
	* kame/rtadvd: obey RFC2461 6.2.5 when rtadvd dies with SIGTERM.
	  read manpage for more details.

Tue Jan 18 12:36:24 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3: good bye __ss_{len,family}, hello ss_{len,family}.

Tue Jan 18 01:43:10 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* openbsd/usr.bin/fstat: make it IPv6 ready.  based on NetBSD PR 9199
	  by Hiroshi Ura.

Tue Jan 18 00:46:09 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/getaddrinfo.c: don't filter out AFs that are not
	  supported by the kernel, when we do address resolution of FQDN.
	  the previous behavior was broken.

Mon Jan 17 13:47:13 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/net/zebra, freebsd3/ports/zebra,
	  openbsd/ports/net/zebra: upgrade to 0.84a.

Mon Jan 17 2000  sakane@kame.net, itojun@kame.net
	* racoon: tons of improvements into our IKE daemon.
	  - SA bundle is now handled correctly (both phase 1/2)
	  - will not SEGV even if last packet in phase 1/2 get resent
	  - KEYMAT generation will take care of long keys correctly
	  - phase 1/2 userfqdn support (ashley-laurent hack)
	  - don't attach DH group type for well-known groups
	  - key length handling is fixed
	  - phase 1 base mode
	  - byte lifetime bug fix (but introduced new bug so still buggy)
	  - parser fixes (issue with DH group setting)
	  - fix variable-length spi support (don't hardcode it to 32bit)
	  - ipcomp negotiation fix
	* kernel ipsec: fix SA reference counting.  now dangling SAs will be
	  cleaned up correctly. (removes incorrect fix on Jan 8 2000)

Mon Jan 17 03:36:44 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/sys/netkey/keysock.c: this file was removed. Now
	  freebsd3 uses shared one, kame/sys/netkey/keysock.c

	  NOTICE: If you use freebsd3 via cvsup/anoncvs, you must clean
	  your source tree and relink shared sources.
	  % cd kame; make TARGET=freebsd3 clean prepare

Mon Jan 17 02:25:54 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* {netbsd,bsdi3,freebsd2}/netstat: try to share souce code across OS
	  platforms as much as possible.  we are able to share ipsec.c without
	  too much troubles.  will try to do it for other platforms, and other
	  portions (like inet6.c).

Sun Jan 16 23:30:16 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/sys/net{inet6,key}: cleanup ipsec logging.  all logs will be
	  generated to syslog, with proper priority (for example, sequence
	  number cycle will be logged with LOG_WARNING).  you can
	  suppress/enable logs by setting net.inet.ipsec.debug (or
	  net.inet6.ipsec6.debug).   even if you supress logs, you can check
	  "netstat -sn" to understand what was happend to ipsec stack.

Sun Jan 16 21:49:38 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/usr.bin/fstat: make it IPv6 ready.
	  NetBSD PR: 9199
	  From: ura@hiru.aoba.yokohama.jp

Sat Jan 15 03:56:50 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ipcomp_core.c: change default deflate window size
	  for inbound to default (2^15).  without this change we can't
	  interoperate with some of IPcomp implementations.
	  see changelog entry on Nov 5 1999.

2000-01-14  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_copypktopts): was added in
	order to copy the in6p_outputopts member from a listening PCB to a
	corresponding accepting one. TCP input routines are also modified
	to call the function.

2000-01-14  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c (ip6_savecontrol): was modified in
	order to conform to Section 4.1 of rfc2292bis-01; TCP
	implementation now passes incoming packet infomration to a user
	(as ancillary data) only when some changes of the content exist.
	Note that this change introduced various related changes of
	transport layers on all the platforms. Please be careful updating.

Fri Jan 14 13:55:19 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/fetchmail: Upgrade to 5.2.3 and sync with
	  FreeBSD-current.

Fri Jan 14 12:15:27 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/rcmd.c: avoid passing dangling pointer to **ahost.
	  we copy the value (ai_canonname, or hp->h_name) to static buffer
	  to keep semantics of rcmd() - requires no free() to the caller.
	  From: Hideaki YOSHIFUJI <yoshfuji@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp>

Fri Jan 14 02:16:16 JST 2000  itojun@itojun.org
	* kame/libpcap/inet.c: improve warning message when libpcap fails to
	  get IPv4 address on the interface it runs on.

Wed Jan 12 17:21:40 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/ruby: Upgrade to 1.4.3 and sync with
	  FreeBSD-cuurent. No extra IPv6 patch is necessary anymore.

Wed Jan 12 15:40:05 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* {bsdi3,netbsd,freebsd2}/usr.sbin/inetd: allow multiple IPsec policy
	  string specifier (separated by semicolon).  to be integrated into
	  other operating systems as well.

Wed Jan 12 05:13:33 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/mrt, netbsd/pkgsrc/net/mrt: Upgrade to 2.1.2a.

2000-01-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_pcbopt): made the
	IPV6_NEXTHOP socket option removal by specifying the option
	with 0 length according to the following mail:
	Message-ID: <Roam.SIMC.2.0.6.947118462.12265.nordmark@jurassic>
	From: Erik Nordmark <Erik.Nordmark@eng.sun.com>
	Date: Wed, 5 Jan 2000 16:27:42 -0800 (PST)

2000-01-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* freebsd[23]/sbin/route/route.c (getaddr): corrected a bug in
	examining interface flags for the RTA_GATEWAY case in getaddr();
	use a separate variable and ioctl in order to get correct flags.
	Note that this fix may introduce a stricter check for arguments of
	the `-interface' modifiers; now you can specify point-to-pointer
	interfaces only, which was the intention of the code.

2000-01-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* bsdi3/sbin/route/route.c (getaddr): reverted the change for the
	"-interface XXX" modifier. We can use the -ifp modifier to
	accomplish the motivation.

2000-01-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/{in6.h, ip6_output}: disabled the following
	socket options, that were just derived from IPv4 and were not
	standards any more;
	IPV6_OPTIONS, IPV6_RECVOPTS, IPV6_RECVRETOPTS, IPV6_RECVDSTADDR,
	and IPV6_RETOPTS.

2000-01-10  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/net/if_gif.c (gif_output): changed the (default) upper
	limit of how many times gif_output can be called.
	Now no nesting is allowed by default, since some systems do not
	allow so many recursive calls in kernel.

Sun Jan  9 10:32:59 JST 2000  sakane@kame.net
	massive clarification to racoon ISAKMP daemon.
	- Merged Eric Lemiere's code for limited certificate support.
	- There are two management hander.
		"Phase 1 handler" is to manage ISAKMP SA.  It is created when
		phase 1 exchange on both initiator and responder side will be
		started.
		"Phase 2 handler" is to manage IPsec SAs.  It is created when
		pfkey acquire message will be received, and when 1st message
		in phase 2 will be received on responder side.
	- Vendor id will be sent after negotiating hasn algorithm.
	  When we receive vendor id before negotiating it, we use default hash
	  algorithm MD5 to check.
	- Post command deleted.
	- msgid_t delted.
	- don't release management handler.  do it only if retry will be
	  timed up.
	- separate the function of isakmp exchange.  one is to check received
	  data.  other is to reply.  the reason is for handling to resend.
	- change name "dir" to "side" in order to distinguish from policy
	  direction.
	- If initiator request PFS, but responder is not ready to do that,
	  responder stops the negotiation.  If initiator don't request PFS,
	  but responder require it, also responder stops the negotiation.

Sun Jan  9 03:03:39 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/heimdal: upgrade to 0.2l.
	* freebsd3/usr.sbin/inetd: support IDENT.
	  From: Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume@mahoroba.org>

Sat Jan  8 23:53:23 JST 2000 sakane@ydc.co.jp
	* kame/sys/netkey/key.c:
	  - fix kenrel crash when flushing SAD.
	  - for stability, increment refcnt of SA when key_getsavbyspi() called.
	  - add some error message
	  - fix errno at key_update().

Sat Jan  8 04:40:33 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/sys/netinet/{frag6,ip6_input,nd6_nbr}.c:
	  use arc4random() on openbsd.  it should give better random value
	  for initializing sequence numbers.
	  From: deraadt@openbsd.org

Sat Jan  8 03:20:05 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* /sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c, kame/sys/netinet6/udp6_usrreq.c:
	  drop incoming udp packet with dst port = 0.  it is, or seems to be,
	  illegal based on RFC768 (99% sure but 1% in doubt).
	  with traditional 4.4BSD code, udp socket will mistakingly accept
	  such packets after socket() and before first bind()/connect().
	  this can be used to confuse, or de-synchronize, udp-based protocols.

Sat Jan  8 00:37:28 2000  Shin'ichi Fujisawa  <fujisawa@kame.net>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/natpt*.[ch]: NAT-PT translator. 
	* kame/kame/{natptconfig,natptd,natptlog}: translator configulation
	  command and natpt related commands.

	- These NAT-PT translator and commands are now under development.
	  Its user interface and overall functionality are subject to
	  future improvements and changes.  So, please be careful when you
	  try it.

	- At this time, this translator works on FreeBSD228 only.  Please
	  wait a while to works on other platforms.

Sat Jan  8 00:09:44 2000  SUMIKAWA Munechika  <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
	* freebsd3/ports/openssh: upgrade to current source of OpenBSD,
	  which support IPv6 in default.  Any additional patches does not
	  neccesary anymore.

2000-01-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c (ip6_output): do not insert a
	dest options header (even if specified by a user) that should be
	placed before a routing header, unless a routing header really
	exists.

2000-01-07  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/rtsold: use raw ip6 socket for probing interface
	status instead of a separate UDP socket, in order to avoid
	receiving unexpected UDP datagrams.
	In response to: kit/187

2000-01-06  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/icmp6.c (icmp6_input): upper layer detection
	in notifying an icmp6 error was improved:
	- if the erroneous packet contains a routing header, examine the
	header to determine the final destination and use it to update
	path MTU.
	- if the erroneous packet contains a fragment header, stop
	chasing the header chain unless it is the first fragment.

	With the former fix the kernel will perform path MTU discovery
	correctly even if triggered packets contain a routing header.

	* A new function icmp6_mtudisc_update() was added to cleanup the
	code.

Thu Jan  6 16:43:52 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netkey/key.c: when searching IPsec SA for inbound IPsec traffic,
	  do not check src match according to RFC2401.  it looks that IPsec
	  specs do not really agree with each other about what should be
	  in IPsec SA, and what should be matched.  see comment lines near
	  key_allocsa().

Thu Jan  6 13:49:43 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c: add missing case for net.inet6.ip6.rr_prune
	  for openbsd and netbsd.
	* netbsd/pkgsrc/net/zebra, freebsd[23]/ports/zebra: upgrade to 0.83a.

Thu Jan  6 01:40:50 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.c: avoid panic on getsockopt(ICMPV6_FILTER).
	  From: shigeya@foretune.co.jp
	* {openbsd,bsdi4}/sys/netinet6/raw_ipv6.c: clarify rip6_ctloutput().

Wed Jan  5 19:44:12 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd/usr.bin/systat, openbsd/usr.bin/systat:
	  make systat IPv6 ready.  "netstat" subcommand is changed for this.

Wed Jan  5 13:27:43 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* kame/libinet6/getnameinfo.c: allow reverse lookup for v4 loopback
	  network (127.0.0.0/8).
	* kame/libinet6/rcmd.c: implement iruserok_sa().  iruserok_af() does
	  not make sense as it is not scope-aware.
	  nuke ruserok_af(), as ruserok() takes string hostname and is af
	  independent already.  we don't really need ruserok_af().
	  iruserok_af() is kept for backward compatibility.  we'll nuke it
	  afterwards.

Wed Jan  5 02:49:05 JST 2000  itojun@iijlab.net
	* netbsd: add net.inet6.ip6.bindv6only sysctl.  this is a replacement
	  of net.inet6.ip6.mapped_addr, which was bitwise opposite to
	  IPV6_BINDV6ONLY.
	  if set to 1: AF_INET6 listening socket will grab IPv6 traffic only.
	  if set to 0: AF_INET6 listening socket will grab IPv4 traffic as well,
		  as if it was from v4 mapped address (described in rfc1933).
	  default value is 1 (i.e. AF_INET6 socket grabs IPv6 traffic only).
	  the variable controls inbound direction only; you can always use
	  v4 mapped address for outgoing connections.

	  "options INET6_BINDV6ONLY" will remove the code completely and
	  hardcodes behavior to net.inet6.ip6.bindv6only=1 case.

	  "options MAPPED_ADDR_ENABLED" and net.inet6.ip6.mapped_addr were
	  obsoleted on netbsd (were introduced on Dec 21 1999).

2000-01-05  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/{bgpd, pim6[ds]d, ping6, traceroute6}: were modified
	to use rfc2292bis by default. Related Makefiles were also
	modified.

2000-01-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/libinet6/{ip6opt.c, rthdr.c}: implemented some new
	functions introduced in rfc2292bis (see TODO.2292bis for more
	details).
	All the new functions except rcmd_af and rexec_af are now
	available.

2000-01-04  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/{various files}: implemented the new advanced
	API (rfc2292bis). The kernel part is now almost finished (see
	TODO.2292bis for more details).
	
	Note about lower compatibility: I believe the new kernel is
	fairly compatible with the old API (i.e. RFC2292).

	There are few compatibility issues in interfaces using ancillary
	data. I believe the compatibility issues won't practically bother
	you.

	You don't have to care compatibility when setting a socket option
	except IPV6_HOPLIMIT. If you use the option but don't want to
	migrate to the new API, you have two choices. One is to use
	IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT instead of IPV6_HOPLIMIT and just keep the other
	code. The other is to define COMPAT_RFC2292 in your kernel
	configuration file and recompile the kernel. Then the kernel will
	handle IPV6_HOPLIMIT in the RFC2292 manner.

	Unfortunately, it is impossible to ensure compatibility for
	getting socket options whose semantics in the new API is different
	than in RFC2292. If you don't want to use the new API but want to
	do getsockopt for such options (I believe the possibility is very
	rare, though) define COMPAT_RFC2292 in your kernel configuration
	file and recompile the kernel. Then the kernel will handle the
	options in the RFC2292 manner.

	Please note that the new API is enabled by default in any case.

	* kame/sys/netkey:
	  don't check sequence number at key_update() even if SA initiator.
	  don't change sequence number passed from userland at key_getspi()
	  instead of the value of sequence number.
	  They can be re-enable to define IPSEC_DOSEQCHECK.

	* kame/libinet6/name6.c: don't bark even if we see T_SIG and other
	  record types.

	* kame/tcpdump/isakmp.h, kame/racoon/isakmp.h:
	  avoid use of bitfield on packet format definition.  it is
	  non-portable.
	* kame/Makefile.inc: added it to share definitions across top-level
	  Makefile and platform Makefile (like netbsd/Makefile).
	  NOTE: if you use anoncvs, you may need to checkout Makefile.inc
	  manually.

	* sys/netinet6/icmp6.[ch]: add net.inet6.icmp6.nodeinfo sysctl MIB,
	  which enables/disables node information query processing in the
	  kernel.
