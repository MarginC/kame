	add ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) support (RFC3168).
	the ECN implementation consists of 3 independent components:
	  - marking mechanism in ALTQ
	  - tunnel-egress and fragment reassenbly rules in layer-3
	  - TCP mechanisms

	to enable ECN support in TCP, build a kernel with TCP_ECN
	and turn it on by sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.ecn=1
	netstat(1) shows the ECN related statistics.

	a simple example setup for ALTQ to mark packets on interface xl0:
		interface xl0 bandwidth 3M red ecn

	* bsdi4/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c (icmp_input): passed applications
	icmp6 error packets that contained ipv6 over ipv4 packets,
	even if the error packet did not have enough length to store the
	whole IPv6 packets.  traceroute -6 in fact needed this behavior.

2002-01-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/kame/traceroute: added a new option "-6" to send IPv6 over
	IPv4 probe packets.  This option will specifically be useful to
	see if an intermediate router rejects the tunneled packets.

2002-01-02  JINMEI, Tatuya  <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>
	* kame/sys/netinet6/in6.h: restricted the use of
	IPV6_RECVRTHDRDSTOPTS in the kernel.  This option was obsoleted in
	rfc2292bis-03.
