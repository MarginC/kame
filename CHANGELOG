	* bsdi4/lib/libinet6:
	* bsdi4/contrib/bind/src/lib:
	massive improvements on DNS resolver including
	- IPv6 transport of DNS resolver. An IPv6 textual address can now
	  be in the /etc/resolv.conf file as a DNS server.
	- support of A6 and DNAME with bit string labels. They are still
	  very experimental, and thus disabled by default. "options a6"
	  and "options dname" in the /etc/resolv.conf file would enable A6
	  and DNAME, respectively.
	- EDNS0 OPT RR support with UDP buffer size negotiation. which is
	  disabled by default, and would enabled by "options edns0" in the
	  /etc/resolv.conf file.
	- clarification on the relationship between address family and irs
	  functions. For example, if you call getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC,
	  and irs.conf specifies to consider the local hosts file first,
	  then getaddrinfo would try to resolve an address in the
	  following order:
	  + IPv6 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv4 addresses in the hosts file.
	  + IPv6 addresses via DNS.
	  + IPv4 addresses via DNS.
	  And, if one of the first two attempts succeeded, the remaining
	  two methods would be skipped. This change of the behavior would
	  be useful if you put both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in the hosts
	  file, and do not want to see redundant DNS packets.
