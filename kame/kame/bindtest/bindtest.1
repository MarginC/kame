.Sh NAME
.Nm bindtest
.Nd test bind(2) behavior on IPv6 implementation
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl st
.Fl p Ar port
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
tests interaction between IPv4/IPv6 socket interface, implemented into
the kernel it has underneath.
.Pp
RFC2553 defines socket API for IPv6, and relationship between
IPv6 wildcard
.Xr bind 2
socket
.Pq Li ::.port
and IPv4 wildcard
.Xr bind 2
socket
.Pq Li 0.0.0.0.port .
However, the document does not define ordering constraints between them,
relationship with specific
.Xr bind 2 ,
nor relationship with speficfic
.Xr bind 2
using IPv4 mapped IPv6 address
.Pq Li ::ffff:127.0.0.1 .
.Pp
.Nm
tries to reveal the behavior implemented in the kernel,
and shows some report to standard output.
As RFC2553 does not define the expected behavior,
we have no idea what the result should be.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
will use
.Dv SOCK_DGRAM
socket for testing.
With
.Fl t ,
.Nm
will use
.Dv SOCK_STREAM
socket instead.
TCP/UDP port number must be specified with
.Fl p Ar port .
The
.Ar port
needs to be vacant.
.Pp
With
.Fl s ,
.Nm
generates summarized output instead of verbose output.
Here are legends for summarized output.
.Nm
will make a two set of
.Xr socket 2
and
.Xr bind 2 .
The first set is presented on the lefthand side.
The second set is presented above the table.
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
.It o
The second
.Xr bind 2
attempt succeed after the first
.Xr bind 2 .
.It x
.Xr bind 2
failed for the second set, with
.Dv EADDRINUSE .
.It !1
.Xr socket 2
failed for the first set.
Normally you will not see this, unless you run
.Nm
on IPv4-only/IPv6-only kernel.
.It !2
.Xr socket 2
failed for the second set.
Normally you will not see this, unless you run
.Nm
on IPv4-only/IPv6-only kernel.
.It ?1
.Xr bind 2
failed for the first set.
.It ?2
.Xr bind 2
failed for the second set, with some error other than
.Dv EADDRINUSE .
.El
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
