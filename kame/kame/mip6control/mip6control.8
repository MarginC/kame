.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets/gets KAME/MIP6 related information.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Speify home interface of the mobile node.
The default value is hif0.
.It Fl H Ar home_prefix
Set
.Ar home_prefix
as a home prefix of the mobile node.
You must specify the prefix length of
.Ar home_prefix
with
.Fl P
option.
.It Fl P Ar prefixlen
Specify the length of the prefix to be assinged to the mobile node.
Use with
.Fl H
option.
.It Fl A Ar home_agent_global_address
Specify the global address of the home agent of this mobile node.
If your home agent supports DHAAD (Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery),
you need not use this switch.
Use with
.Fl L
option.
.It Fl L Ar home_agent_linklocal_address
Specify the linklocal address of the home agent of this mobile node.
If your home agent supports DHAAD (Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery),
you need not use this switch.
Use with
.Fl A
option.
.It Fl m
Start acting as a mobile node.
.It Fl n
Show network addresses as numbers.
.It Fl h
Show the home prefixes currently set to this mobile node.
.It Fl a
Show the home agents list.
.It Fl b
Show the binding update list.
.It Fl g
Start acting as a home agent.
.It Fl c
Show the binding cache entries.
.It Fl l
Show information in a long format.
.It Fl u Ar Address#Port
Add a rule that MN doesn't add a Home Address option to the outgoing packet.
.It Fl v Ar Address#Port
Delete the rule which specified one.
.It Fl w
Show the rule.
.It Fl F Ar [ifp1[:ifp2[:ifp3]]]
Set preferrable network interfaces for CoA selection.
Specify nothing to remove the preferences.
.It Fl S Ar 0|1
When set to 0, the IPsec protection check of the incoming binding updates
and binding acks will not be performed (always pass the check).
.It Fl T Ar 0|1
When set to 0, the authentication sub-option check of the incoming binding
updates and binding acks will not be performed.  Also, do not insert
the authentication sub-option when sending the binding updates/binding
acks.  Note that, mip6control -S 1 -T 0 doesn't mean 'use only the IPsec
mechanism to protect binding updates and binging acks' in ID-15
environment.  This is equivalent to mip6control -S 0 -T 0 in ID-15
environment.
.It Fl D Ar 0|1
When set to 0, no debug messages are printed.

.Sh EXAMPLES
To make a node act as a mobile node, issue the following commands as a root.

root# mip6control -m
.Ed
.Pp
Replace 2001:200:1:1:: with your home network prefix.
