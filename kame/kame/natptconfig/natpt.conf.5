.Sh NAME
.Nm natpt.conf
.Nd configuration file for KAME NAT-PT
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
describes the configuration file format for
.Xr natptconfig 8 .
However
.Xr natptconfig 8
does not have default configuration file, this filename
.Pq Nm
is as an example.
.Pp
This file consists of a sequence of statements.  Each statement is
beginning with directive.  Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.  Blank line is ignored.
.Pp
Each rule processed by this translater is added in the kernel internal
list if there is no parsing problems.  When more than one rule is
described, rule that has an error is not added, but the rule that has
no error is added to this list.  Rules are added to the end of the
internal lists using
.Qq map
directive, matching the
order in which they appear when given in natptconfig.
.\"
.Sh DIRECTIVES
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using
.Sy this
font.  Parameters are specified with
.Em this
font.  Square brackets
.Pq So \&[ Sc and So \&] Sc
are used to show optional keywords and parameters.  Parentheses
.Pq So \&( Sc and So \&) Sc
are used to group keywords and parameters when necessary.  The
vertical bar
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to indicate a choice between optional
parameters.
.Pp
The following directives are available in the configuration file.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\"
.It Xo Sy prefix
.Xc
Set NAT-PT prefix.  Packet addressed to this prefix is subject to
translate.  Prefix length is always assumed as 96 bits.
.\"
.It Xo Sy map from ...
.Xc
Add translation rule into the kernel internal list.  The rules for
returning packet is not appear in this map list.  The following
formats are available.
.Bl -tag -compact -width XXX
.Pp
.\"	map from any6               to 202.249.11.250 port 28672 - 32767
.\"	map from 3ffe:501:4819::/48 to 202.249.11.250 port 28672 - 32767
.It Xo Sy map from any6 to Ar v4addr
.Op Sy port Ar num Sy - Ar mum
.Xc
.It Xo Sy map from Ar v6addr
.Op Sy \&/ Ar num
.Sy to Ar v4addr
.Op Sy port Ar num Sy - Ar mum
.Xc
Translate IPv6 packet to IPv4 packet.
.Pp
The former is translate IPv6 packet coming from arbitrary host.  The
latter is translate IPv4 packet coming from specified host or address
range.  Both rules translate incoming IPv6 packet to packet coming out
of specified IPv4 address.  The number after
.Sy \&/
specifies address mask.  When address mask is not specified, it is
treated as if 
.Sy \&/
128 is specified.  If
.Sy port
is specified, convert source port number into the number that is not
used with specified range.  If not, source port number is not
converted.
.Pp
.\"	map from 202.249.11.251 dport 65305 to 3ffe:0501:041c::1 dport 23
.It Xo Sy map from
.Ar v4addr Op Sy dport Ar num
.Sy to
.Ar v6addr
.Op Sy dport Ar num
.Xc
Translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet.
.Pp
This format was changed to the format using
.Sy daddr/dport .
It is recommended not to use this format because this format may be
abolished in the future.  Use the following rule instead.
.Pp
.\"	map from daddr 10.21.32.252 to daddr 2001:0240:010a:5555:0260:08ff:feb0:96f4
.It Xo Sy map from daddr Ar v4addr
.Sy to daddr Ar v6addr
.Xc
Translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet.
.Pp
IPv4 packet destined to specified IPv4 address is translated to IPv6
packet going to specified address.  This rule translate both source
and destination address.
.Pp
.\"	map from any4       to 202.249.11.252 port 28672 - 32767
.\"	map from 10.0.0.3/8 to 202.249.11.252 port 28672 - 32767
.It Xo Sy map from any4 to Ar v4addr
.Op Sy port Ar num Sy - Ar mum
.Xc
.It Xo Sy map from Ar v4addr
.Op Sy \&/ Ar num
.Sy to Ar v4addr
.Op Sy port Ar num Sy - Ar mum
.Xc
Translate IPv4 packet to IPv4 packet.
.Pp
The former is translate IPv4 packet coming from arbitrary host.  The
latter is translate IPv4 packet coming from specified host or address
range.  Both rules translate incoming IPv4 packet to packet coming out
of specified IPv4 address.  The number after
.Sy \&/
specifies address mask.  When address mask is not specified, it is
treated as if 
.Sy \&/
32 is specified.  If
.Sy port
is specified, convert source port number into the number that is not
used with specified range.  If not, source port number is not
converted.  This facility
.Pq IPv4-IPv4 translation
is same as a lot of NAT used in the world.
.El
.Pp
All the rules mentioned above
.Pq Sy map from ...
can have
.Op Sy proto Ar protcol
option.  This option specifies the protocol, specify
.Sy icmp tcp
and
.Sy udp
separated by 
.Ql Sy \&/ .
For example, 
.Sy proto tcp/udp .
There is no meaning in order of protocol to specify, and there is no
syntax error when you specify more then one same protocol.  This
.Sy proto
option must be specified at the last of syntax except a case of using
.Sy bidir
option.
.Pp
Option
.Sy bidir
is used when specified bi-directional NAT.  This NAT binds global
address to private address one-on-one statically.  Sessions can be
initiated from hosts in the public network as well as the private
network.  So, if you can set nat session as bidirectional, you can
connect to the host located behind this NAT from public IPv4 network.
.Pp
Here are some important points to consider when using
.Sy bidir 
option:
.Bl -bullet
.It
This
.Sy bidir
option must be specified at the last of syntax.
.It
Number of address that specify by
.Sy from
and
.Sy to
is 1.  You can not specify more than one address here because
translation is ono-on-one.
.It
Does not translate port number.  So You need several IPv4 address, an
equal number of host to be connected to.
.It
It is recommended that the IP address which described after
.Sy to
is set different from IP address assigned to interface of this NAT
box.  Or NAT can not receive a packet destined to NAT itself because
this NAT translate the packet which come to this IP address
unconditionally.
.Pp
.Fl alias
option of ifconfig command is usable to do this purpose.  See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for more detail.
.El
.\"
.It Xo Sy map flush
.Xc
Remove all translation rules from the kernel.  There is no way to
remove only one rule.
.\"
.It Xo Sy map
.Pq Sy enable|disable
.Xc
Enable or disable translation.  Initial status is disabled.
.\"
.It Xo Sy set Ar var Ar = Ar value
.Xc
Set the value to the variable.  Allowed variable is as follows.
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Sy natpt_debug
This is for debug.
.It Sy natpt_dump
When set, dump mbuf or ip packet.  You must run natptlog command to
show its dump.
.El
.Pp
You can examine these variables and it's value with invoking following
command.
.Dl # natptconfig show variables
.Pp
However, you cannot set all of the variables which can appear with
show subcommand.
.El
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example is typical NAT-PT configuration.
IPv6 packets which has the prefix
.Em 3ffe:ffff:ffff:ffff::/96
are translated into IPv4 packet.
Source address of the translated IPv4 packets are set to
.Em 172.16.11.22 .
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefix 3ffe:ffff:ffff:ffff::
map from any6 to 172.16.11.22
map enable
.Ed
.\"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Caution is needed because some syntax was changed.  The following is
changed point of syntax.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ql interface
directive was removed.
.It
about
.Ql prefix
directive, word
.Ql natpt
became needless.
.It
about
.Ql map
directive, word
.Ql inbound
and
.Ql outbound
became needless.  Use
.Ql dport
when you want to change destination port number.  i.e.,
.Bd -literal -offset XXXX
map from 202.249.11.251 dport 65305 to 3ffe:0501:041c::1 dport 23
