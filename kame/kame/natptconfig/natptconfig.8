.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm natptconfig
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Fl f Ar configfile
.Nm natptconfig
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Ar subcommand Op Ar args...
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Natptconfig
configures and control the IPv6-to-IPv4 translator implemented in the
kernel.
.Pp
.Nm Natptconfig
takes the following command line options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Set debug level to
.Ar debuglevel .
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Evaluate the content of file specified by
.Ar configfile ,
as configuration directives.
By specifying
.Dq Li - ,
standard input is used.
.Pp
.El
The first form 
.Pq with Fl f
takes directives from the specified configuration file.
The second form is to give single directive directly from the command line.
.\"
.Sh DIRECTIVES
Each rule processed by translater is added in the kernel internal
lists if there is no parsing problems.	Rules are added to the end of
the internal lists using "map" natptconfig directive, matching the
order in which they appear when given in natptconfig.
.Pp
The following directives are available in the configuration file.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\"
.It Xo
.Li interface
.Ar interfaceName
.Li (internal|external)
.Xc
Mark interface <interfaceName> as external (outside) or internal
(inside).  External (outside) means that the interface is on the
Internet side, and internal (inside) means that the interface is on
the private side.  Only packets arriving on this interface will be
subject to IPv6-to-IPv4 protocol translation.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li prefix natpt
.Ar v6addr Li / Ar prefixlen
.Xc
Set NAT-PT prefix, and packet addressed to this prefix will subject to
translate.  A number followed by a slash (/) represent the number of
bits significant in the IP address.  96bit prefix is used in case of
most.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li map (inbound|outbound) from
.Ar v6addr
.Op Ar port
.Li to
.Ar v4addr
.Op Ar port
.Xc
Add translater rule into the kernel internal lists.  Outgoing or
incoming packet mathes this rule will subject to translate.  The rules
for returning packet is not appear in this map list.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li map flush [(static|dynamic)]
.Xc
Remove all rules from the kernel.  If static or dynamic was specified,
corresponding rule will removed.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li map (enable|disable)
.Xc
Enable or disable translation.
.El
.Pp
The following directives are available in interactive use.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\"
.It Xo
.Li ?
.Xc
Show available actions on each stage.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li set Ar var Li = Ar value
.Xc
This option allows to setting of the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It natpt_debug
.It natpt_dump
When set, dump mbuf or ip packet.  You must run natptlog command to
show its dump.
.El
.Pp
Value can use decimal or hexadecimal (begin with 0x) notation.
Currently, blank of each side of '=' is not allowed.
.\"
.It Xo
.Li show Ar subcommand Op Ar args...
.Xc
Show various useful information.
.Nm natptconfig
read this information from kernel, so you must have read permission of
/dev/kmem.
Available subcommands are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It ?
Show available subcommands on each stage.
.It interface
Show interface setting.
.It prefix
Show NAT-PT prefix and prefix mask.
.It static
Show NAT-PT rules which set by statically.
.It dynamic
Show NAT-PT rules which set by dynamically.
.It Xo
.Li xlate
.Op Li long
.Op Ar interval
.Xc
Show NAT-PT current translation table entry.
.Ar interval
is a number, and this option specified,
.Nm natptconfig
will continuously display the information which is shown with xlate
subcommand in specified second interval.
.Pp
By default, this command display IPv6 as short format (22 columns per
address), when 'long' specified, this command display IPv6 address
without omitting it.
.Pp
It is useful to see this
table entry when this translator seems not to work.  See
.Em TABLE FORMAT
section below for more detail.
.It variables
Show variables set with set subcommand.
.It mapping
Show current mapping status.  Status is displayed as "enable" or "disable".
.El
.It test Ar subcommand Op Ar args...
Test log system.  You must run natptlog command.  When only log
specified, send LOGTESTPATTERN to translator, and translator send this
pattern to log system.  When you running natptlog command, this
command display LOGTESTPATTERN.  Current available subcommands are
shown.
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It ?
Show available subcommands on each stage.
.It log
Send predefined pattern LOGTESTPATTERN to the log system.
.It log Ar name
Send one word to the log system.
.It log Ar string
Send double quoted string to the log system.  String should be double
quoted.
.El
.\"
.Sh RUNNING NAT-PT
The following steps are necessary before attempting to run
.Nm NAT-PT:
.Bl -enum
.It
Build a custom kernel with uncomment the following options:

    options NATPT

This options is commented with distributed GENERIC.V6 as a default.
Refer to the handbook for detailed instructions on building a custom
kernel.
.It
Ensure that your machine is acting as a gateway.  This can be done by
specifying the line

    ip6router=YES

in
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/rc.net6 .
.It
Write natpt configuration and set its configuration into kernel.
See
.Em EXAMPLE 1
section below for more detail.
.It
When NAT-PT seems not to work properly, try next procedure.
.Bl -enum
.It
Use show xlate command, and see current translation table entry.
.It
Set the natpt_dump variable to appropriately value, and see mbuf or ip
packet dump generated with natptlog command.
.El
.El

.Sh EXAMPLE 1
The following is an example of '?' directive.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
% natptconfig ?
	interface	Mark interface as outside or inside.
	map		Set translation rule.
	set		Set  value to in-kernel variable.
	show		Show setting.
% natptconfig interface ?
	<interfaceName> (internal|external)
%
.Ed
.Pp
The following is an example of a typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl % natptconfig -f natpt.conf
.Pp
The following is an example of a content of the
.Nm
configuration file.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset
% cat natptconfig.conf
interface fxp0 external
prefix natpt 3ffe:0501:4819:c1ad::/96
map outbound from 3ffe:0501:4819:6000::/64 to 172.16.196.1 port 28672 - 32767
map enable
%
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLE 2
Assume mapping rule was set as follows,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
map inbound  from 203.178.141.196 port 65303 \\
	     to 3ffe:501:4819:6000:200:f4ff:fe5c:3599 port 23
.Ed
.Pp
When v4 packet is coming from outside to this machine, and when its
packet's dstaddr == 203.178.141.196 and dstport == 65303, this v4
packet is translated to v6, dstaddr == 3ffe:..3559 and desport == 23,
so this packet will send to v6 machine to telnet port.
.Pp
So, this function is restricted with TCP and UDP, and you must know
destination address and port number (in this case 65303) before send 
packet.
.Pp
Some people say this function is enough and this restriction (to
know port mapping ahead of making session, and cannot connect any
port before set mapping configuration) is acceptable.
.\"
.Sh TABLE FORMAT
This is a one sample of 'show xlate' output.  Sorry, this table entry
was too long, show this entry over two lines.
.Bd -literal -offset
tcp 3ffe:501:4819:c1ad::857b:10bf.23 3ffe:501:4819:6001:2e0:18ff:fea8:4e66.1041
  133.123.16.193.28686 133.123.16.191.23 00:00:01 SYN_SENT
.Ed
.Pp
This entry has 7 fields.  The leftmost field shows protocol.  The
second and third field shows src.port and dst.port of internal side.
The forth and fifth field show src.port and dst.port of external side.
The sixth field shows the time (second) from last packet matches this
entry.  The last field has TCP inner status.  Of course, the last
field appears only protocol is TCP.
.Pp
When use 'long' directive with 'show xlate', these table show as below
.Bd -literal -offset
tcp 3ffe=857b:10bf.23 3ffe=fea8:4e66.1041 
  133.123.16.193.28686 133.123.16.191.23 00:00:01 SYN_SENT
.Ed
.Pp
This entry has same field as above, but IPv6 address was shrinked to
14 columns, so it is easy to see this table entry.  Each IPv6 address
was shown as first 4 column and last 9 column connecting with '='
character.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
(to be written)
.\"
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command is now under development.  It's user interface and overall
functionality are subjects to future improvements and changes.
.Pp
This translator will not automatically perform proxy ARP.  Therefore,
you may need to configure the translator box for proxy ARP, or
configure alias IP address by using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
.Nm Natptconfig
show subcommand read many information from kernel device
(ie. /dev/kmem), so you must have read permission of this device.
