.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
subcommand
.Op Ar args ...
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
configures and control the IPv6-to-IPv4 translator implemented in the
kernel.
.Pp
.Nm
takes the following command line options.
.Bl -tag witdh Ds
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Set debug level to
.Ar debuglevel .
This option is for debug.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Evaluate the contents of file specified as configfile.  By specifying
.Ql -
as a file name, standard input is used.
.El
.Pp
The first form
.Pq with Fl f
takes directives from the specified configuration file.  The second
form is to give single directive directly from the command line.
.\"
.Sh DIRECTIVES
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using
.Sy this
font.  Parameters are specified with
.Em this
font.  Square brackets (
.Ql \&[
and
.Ql \&]
) are used to show optional keywords and parameters.  Parentheses(
.Ql \&(
and
.Ql \&)
) are used to group keywords and parameters when necessary.  The
vertical bar
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to indicate a choice between optional
parameters.
.Pp
The following directives are available in interactive use.

.\"
.It Xo Sy show Ar subcommand
.Op Ar args ...
.Xc
Show various useful information.
.Nm
read this information from kernel, so you must have read permission of
/dev/kmem.  Available subcommands are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Xo Sy \&?
.Xc
Show available subcommands on this stage.
.It Xo Sy prefix
.Xc
Show NAT-PT prefix and prefix mask.
.It Xo Sy rules
.Xc
Show NAT-PT rules
.It Xo Sy xlate
.Op Sy long
.Op Ar interval
.Xc
Show NAT-PT current translation table entry.  An entry of this table
is empty at first.  Kernel forms an entry that packet flows, 1 entry
per 1 TCP session, 1 entry per 1 UDP/ICMP packet.
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
.Qq long
shows with long format.
.It
.Ql interval
is a number, and this option specified,
.Nm
will continuously display the information which is shown with xlate
subcommand in specified second interval.
.El
.Pp
By default, this command display IPv6 as short format (22 columns per
address), when
.Qq long
specified, this command display IPv6 address
without omitting it.
.Pp
It is useful to see this
table entry when this translator seems not to work.  See
.Em TABLE FORMAT
section below for more detail.
.It Xo Sy variables
.Xc
Show variables set with set subcommand.
.It Xo Sy mapping
.Xc
Show current mapping status.  Status is displayed as "enable" or
"disable".
.El
.It Xo Sy test Ar subcommand
.Op Ar args ...
.Xc
Test the log system.  You must run natptlog command.  When only log
specified, send LOGTESTPATTERN to translator, and translator send this
pattern to log system.  When you running natptlog command, this
command display LOGTESTPATTERN.  Current available subcommands are
shown.
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Xo Sy \&?
.Xc
Show available subcommands on this stage.
.It Xo Sy log
.Xc
Send predefined pattern LOGTESTPATTERN to the log system.
.It Xo Sy log Li name
.Xc
Send one word to the log system.
.It Xo Sy log Qq string
.Xc
Send double quoted string to the log system.
