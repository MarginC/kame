.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
detects and deletes the dead security association.
.Nm
searches the security association database in the kernel periodically,
then sends ICMP echo requests to the peer of each SA.
if any ICMP echo reply won't be back,
.Nm
will delete the SA immediately.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
specify the number of icmp echo packet to be sent.
default is 2 times.
.It Fl L
force to check only once.
.It Fl i
(a) if the current round takes more than the specified
time in seconds the next round will start immediately
after the current will finish.  (b) otherwise the next
will start after the specified time from the current
first check.
default is 300 seconds.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
can only detect SA which based IP address.
When the SA is only applyed to TCP session
and there is no SA parameter on the peer,
.Nm
cannot detect this dead SA because
.Nm
uses the ICMP echo request and ICMP packets is not applyed the SA.
.Nm
should use the packets accroding to SPD in order to check SAs.
