.Sh NAME
.Nm KAME
.Nd introduction and roadmap to KAME IPv6 software package
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm KAME
software package is a result of joint work of several IPv6 researchers
in Japan, to provide reference implementation of IPv6 to
Berkeley Software Distribution
.Pq BSD
derived system such as BSD/OS,
FreeBSD and NetBSD
.Pq in alphabetical order .
.Pp
.\" Package consists of set of patches and additions to kernel,
.\" modification to application, daemons, header files and libraries.
KAME kit consists of IPv6/IPsec-ready kernel, application, daemons,
header files and libraries.
.\"
.Sh HIGHLIGHTS
Following are some of highlights of this implementation.
