.Sh NAME
.Nm stf
.Nd
.Tn 6to4 tunnel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device stf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface supports
.Dq 6to4
encapsulation.
It can tunnel IPv6 traffic over IPv4, as specified in
.Li draft-ietf-ngtrans-6to4-03.txt .
.Pp
Due to the way 6to4 protocol is specified,
.Nm
interface requires certain configuration to work properly.
Read the specification for configuration details.
.Pp
.Nm
can be configured to be ECN friendly.
This can be configured by
.Dv IFF_LINK1 .
See
.Xr gif 4
for details.
.Pp
Please note that 6to4 is inherently
.Dq accept tunnelled packet from everyone
tunnelling device.
By enabling
.Nm
device, you are making it much easier for attackers
to inject malicious IPv6 packet to your node.
Administrators must take caution when enabling it.
It is recommended to filter IPv4 packet as necessary.
