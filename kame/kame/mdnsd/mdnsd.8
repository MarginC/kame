.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
serves as multicast DNS resolver.
.Nm
will get unicast DNS queries from local node,
and forward the queries toward multicast DNS address on interface specified by
.Ar intface .
Whenever a reply comes back against the multicast queries,
.Nm
will forward the reply to the original querier.
.Pp
.Nm
will also reply to multicast DNS queries from other nodes.
.Pp
.Fl 4
and
.Fl 6
controls the address family to use for DNS transport.
.Pp
With
.Fl d ,
.Nm
will advertise DNS server
.Ar dnsserv
to
.Li _dns._udp.lcl
SRV queries.
.Ar dnsserv
must be a fully qualified canonical DNS name.
.Ar dnsserv
must not point to CNAME record.
Also, it must carry terminating period, like
.Dq Li ns.ietf.org. .
.Pp
.Fl p
lets you change the listening UDP port.
