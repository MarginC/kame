.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
serves as multicast DNS resolver.
.Nm
will get unicast DNS queries from local node,
and forward the queries toward link-local multicast DNS address on
.Ar intface .
Whenever a reply comes back against the multicast queries,
.Nm
will forward the reply to the original querier.
.Nm
can also relay queries to unicast DNS server(s).
.Pp
.Nm
will reply to multicast DNS queries from other nodes,
to advertise mapping between the name of the local node and the addresses
of the local node.
If two or more nodes on the same link are running
.Nm Ns ,
they can resolve their addresses without having to configure unicast
DNS servers.
Users just need to know the FQDN name for the neighboring node.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
.It Fl 6
Controls the address family to use for DNS transport.
By default
.Nm
will listen to all the available address families.
.It Fl D
Enable trace messages for debugging.
.It Fl f
Run in foreground mode.
Do not daemonize on invocation.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
.Ar hostname
specifies local hostname that
.Nm
will serve against incoming unicast/multicast queries.
If ommitted, result from
.Xr gethostname 3
will be used.
.Ar hostname
must be an FQDN, terminated by dot.
.It Fl i Ar intface
.Ar intface
specifies outgoing interface for multicast queries.
The flag is mandatory.
.It Fl l
Advertise scoped addresses against queries from IPv6 link-local address,
or loopback address.
Care must be taken if you enable it,
scoped address and DNS are not really friendly.
.It Fl m
Be compatible with
.Dq mediator
DNS cache daemon.
Redistribution of 
.Dq mediator
code is
.Pq still 
restricted, hence
.Fl m
flag is not very useful for most of users.
Do not send questions about this
.Li :-)
.It Fl N
Transmit ICMPv6 node information queries, instead of multicast DNS queries,
for resolving names on the adjacent link.
.It Fl p Ar inport
.Nm
listens to UDP port
.Ar inport
for incoming DNS multicast/unicast queries, or unicast replies.
By default,
.Ar inport
will be 53.
.Fl p
is for debugging purposes only.
.It Fl P Ar outport
.Nm
transmits UDP multicast queries to UDP port
.Ar outport.
By default,
.Ar outport
will be 53.
.Fl P
is for debugging purposes only
.Po
for running two daemons on a single node
.Pc .
.It Ar userv
Specify unicast DNS servers we may want to try sending queries.
Users can list multiple DNS servers.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
will generate status dump file on signal

.Sh EXAMPLES
First, run
.Nm
on UDP port 53
.Pq standard DNS UDP port .
You need to be root to issue
.Xr bind 2
on privileged port.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mdnsd -6 -i wi0
.Ed
.Pp
Then, configure
.Xr resolv.conf 5
to resolve IP addresses from names using
.Nm Ns .
Notice the presense of
.Li itojun.org.local.arpa.
and
.Li local.arpa.
From the speficiation, we can only resolve names using multicast DNS,
iff names are under
.Li local.arpa.
domain.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
search itojun.org itojun.org.local.arpa local.arpa
nameserver ::
.Ed
.Pp
If you would like to contact unicast DNS servers as well, you may want to
specify them on the command line.
DNS queries will be sent to unicast servers, if the DNS name is outside of
.Li local.arpa.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
Specification conformance is still very low.
Some of
.Pq or most of
the features are not implemented yet.
.Pp
Since there is no standard IPv6 multicast address assigned for multicast DNS,
we use linklocal all-node multicast address at this moment.
.Pp
IPv4 multicast query/reply does not work at this moment.
.Pp
.Nm
is too aggressive when sending queries.
For example, if you specify unicast DNS servers by
.Ar userv
argument,
.Nm
will transmit DNS queries every time a client asks
.Nm
about the record.
Instead,
.Nm
should add some delay between subsequent transmissions,
and implement cache mechanisms
.Pq both positive and negative .
.Pp
.Nm
requires interface
.Ar intface
to be available and in
.Dv IFF_UP
state, on invocation.
This may be too much to ask for laptop usage.
.Pp
.Nm
does not support EDNS0 option.
Also,
.Nm
handles DNS queries/replies over virtual connection
.Pq Tn TCP
naively.
.Pp
.Fl N
may not be very useful, as DNS responses will contain link-local addresses.
