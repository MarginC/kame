.Op Fl n Ar dnsserv
.Op Fl N Ar dnsdom
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
replies to DHCPv6 client as DHCPv6 server.
.Nm
is able to give the following information to clients.
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
IPv6 address of DNS server
.Pq Fl n Ar dnsserv
.It
DNS domain name
.Pq Fl N Ar dnsdom
.It
Current timezone offset
.It
IEEE 1003.1 information for current timezone
.El
.Pp
Command line options are as below:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f

it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.It Fl n Ar dnsserv
The option specifies DNS server address to be passed to clients.
This option can be used multiple times in order to specify more than one

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several aspects.
To name a few:
.Bl -enum
.It
it does not manage client-agent mapping table nor client XID,
.It
it does not handle resource allocations
.Pq such as an IPv6 address ,
.It
it does not implement DHCPv6 release nor reconfigure message handling.
