.Dt DHCP6SCTL 8
.Os KAME
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6sctl
.Nd DHCPv6 server control utility
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl k Ar keyfile
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl s Ar server_address
.Ic command
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
controls the operation of
.Nm dhcp6s ,
a DHCPv6 server.
.Pp
.Nm
communicates with the DHCPv6 server over a TCP connection,
sending commands authenticated with digital signatures.
Currently,
the only supported authentication algorithm is
HMAC-MD5,
which uses a shared secret on each end of the connection.
.Pp
Command line options are as below:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Use
.Ar keyfile
to provide the shared secret to communicate with the server.
The default file name used when unspecified is
.Pa /etc/dhcp6sctlkey .
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify
.Ar port
as the listening port of the server.
The default port number used when unspecified is 5546.
.It Fl s Ar server_address
Specify
.Ar server_address
as the listening address of the server.
The default address used when unspecified is ::1.
.El
.\"
.Sh KEY FILE
Since the operation available with the
.Nm
command is powerful,
the communication between the command and
.Nm dhcp6s
must be authenticated.
The supported algorithm for authentication is HMAC-MD5,
which requires a shared secret,
and the secret is stored in the key file.
The key file must consist of a single line, in which the secret value
is written in the form of BASE-64 encoding.
.\"
.Sh COMMANDS
Each
.Ic command
specifies a single control operation.
Supported commands are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic reload
.Xc
This command specifies the server to reload the configuration file.
Existing bindings, if any, are intact.
.It Xo
.Ic remove Ar arguments
.Xc
This command specifies the server to remove a run-time object
specified by
.Ar arguments
from the server.
Currently only possible object is one particular IA_PD binding,
which is specified as
.Ic IA Ic IA_PD Ar IAID Ar DUID
where
.Ar IAID
is a decimal number specifying the ID of identity association (IA),
and
.Ar DUID
is a DHCP Unique Identifier of the binding.
The format of
.Ar DUID
is the same as that specified in
.Xr dhcp6s.conf 5 .
.El
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/dhcp6sctlkey -compact
.It Pa /etc/dhcp6sctlkey
is the default key file.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
