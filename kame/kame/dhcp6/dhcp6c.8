.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.

signal,
.Nm
will reinvoke itself, unless it is still soliciting servers or
requesting resources.

.Nm
is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several aspects.
To name a few:
.Bl -enum
.It
it does not handle resource allocations
.Pq such as IPv6 address ,
.It
it does not install information it gets from DHCPv6 server into the system
.Pq such as DNS server, DNS domain name, timezone .
