HOW DO I DO ?
Q. ID payload handling in phase 2 besides IPSECDOI_ID_IP*.
   e.g. IPSECDOI_ID_DER_ASN1_DN.  Well, are these used in phase 2 ?
Q. What should I do when HARD expiration has come ?
Q. When a node has multi address, I check only destination address on phase 2.
	Should we check both src and dst?
Q. replay prevention
	limited number of session
	limited session per peer
	number of proposal
	....
Q. how to support multi interfaces ?
	perform a dummy connect(2), like ping6.
	bind multi address, like named.
   now racoon uses the former way.
Q. The padding for data attribute.
	in particular, variable-length attribute like ID-userfqdn.
Q. vendorid's hash algorithm
	For aggressive mode ?.
	In mail mode, should I use negotiated algorithm ?

	-> it's not negotiated
Q. encryption during aggressive mode.
	when receive encrypted packet of 1st exchange from responder,
	it can be decoded.  When we are responder, should we send encrypted ?
Q. What is the perpose of exchange of DH attribute on quick mode ?
	-> pfs
Q. Should I do acceptable check of phase 2 pfs group ?.
   If initiator requests PFS, should we accept without acceptable check.
	-> well-known issue

Q. RESPONDER-LIFETIME is only one payload in a IKE message even in the case
   of SA bundle case is ?
A. At the moment, racoon sends this notify payload(s) against each protocol.

Q. Which is SPI to be used initiator's or responder's when sending
   RESPONDER-LIFETIME ?
A. At the moment, racoon sends responder's one.

Q. Is it typo that a body of nonce payload during base mode exchange.
            HDR, SA, Idii, Ni_b     =>
                           Ni ???
                                    <= HDR, SA, Idir, Nr_b
                                                      Nr ???
A. Yes, typo. (by network associates.)

Q. What's proto_id in notify message of responder 2nd message with commit bit
  processing when multiple different SA applyed ?
Q. Is it forbidden to clear commit bit during phase2 negotiation ?
	-> not forbidden,

Q. how many time is the notify message sent ?
A. don't resend notify message because peer can use Acknowledged
   Informational if peer requires the reply of the notify message.

Q. What kind of policy configuration is desired?
   policy.conf makes sense in certain situations only, such as:
   - we are the initiator, and trying to enforce certain configuration.

   If we would like to talk with strangers (like IPsec-ready webserver, or
   "IPsec with everyone" configuration), or need to move from place to place
   (like IPsec-ready nomadic node), we need an ability to write "wildcard
   policy entry" which matches situations/packets/whatever, and then install
   non-wildcard policy entry into the kernel.
   For example:
   - policy.conf says 0.0.0.0/0 -> 0.0.0.0/0, protocol "any", type "use",
     for "encrypt everything" configuration.
   - phase 2 ID payload will be exchanged for real address we have, and the
     peer has (a.b.c.d/32).  This is not the same as "0.0.0.0/0" configured
     onto policy entry.
   - with the current code, policy.conf and phase 2 ID does not match, and
     it will fail.

   If we are acting as responder, we will be making policy entry from phase 2
   IDs.  Is it always okay to accept phase 2 IDs as is, into our kernel policy?
   We'll need to have filtering rule, or mapping rules from phase 2 IDs to
   kernel policy.
   For example:
   - we have 10.1.1.0/24 -> 10.1.2.0/24, protocol "any" in policy.conf.
   - what happens if we get, as responder, 10.1.1.0/25 -> 10.1.2.0/25,
     protocol "any"?  should we accept it as is, or should we respect our
     configuration?
     if we respect our configuration, 10.1.1.128/25 -> 10.1.2.128/25 traffic
     will be encrypted from our side, and end up being dropped by the peer.
   - what happens if we get, as responder, 10.1.1.0/24 -> 10.1.2.0/24,
     protocol "tcp"?  should we accept it as is, or should we respect our
     configuration?
     if we respect our configuration, non-tcp traffic will be dropped on
     the peer.

   -> the question is obsoleted by configuration language change.

Q. What's msgid of informational exchange for error notify message during
   phase2 ?  Is it same as msgid of phase2 negotiation caused error ?
   Or new msgid created ?  If later case, spi must be conveyed.
	-> new msgid should be used
	-> then, how can we deduce phase 2 from the notification?

Q. I don't know the situation to initiate acknowledged informational.

Q. How many certificate payload in a packet are sent ?
   isakmp-test.ssh.fi send both CRL and CERT in a packet.

Q. What should we do if nonce size is greater than size of RSA modulus
   in authentication with public key encryption, also size of body of
   ID payload ?

Q. For IKE negotiation of IPComp, how should we encode CPI (2 byte) into SPI
   field of proposal payload (for AH/ESP, normally 4 bytes)?
   Options are as follows:
   (1) put it as 4 byte value, set SPI size to 4
                          1                   2                   3

   (2) put it as 2 byte value, set SPI size to 2.  No padding must be made.
                          1                   2                   3

   IRE did (1), IIRC. (Jan 2000)

   SSH does (2), and rejects (1). (Sep 2000)

   The following email suggests (2) for normal case, and allow (1) for backward
   compatibility (responder case I bet).
	To: ipsec@lists.tislabs.com
	From: Joern Sierwald <joern.sierwald@datafellows.com>

A: (2) for normal case, and allow (1) for backward compatibility
   (responder case I bet).  <draft-shacham-ippcp-rfc2393bis-05.txt>

Q. INITIAL-CONTACT message.
   When should we issue an INITIAL-CONTACT message?
	-> see jenkins rekey draft

   We must ignore unencrypted INITIAL-CONTACT message.

   If we have two nodes and they issue the first packet of phase 1 at the same
   time, both may try to transmit INITIAL-CONTACT message, and effectively
   kills both connection attempt.

	node 1			node 2
	  |			  |
	  |----------\  /---------| phase 1 first packet
	  |	      \/	  |
	  |	      /\	  |
	  |<---------/  \-------->|
	  |----------\  /---------| INITIAL-CONTACT
	  |	      \/	  |
	  |	      /\	  |
	  |<---------/  \-------->|

   Options are as follows:
   (1) don't throw INITIAL-CONTACT message.
   (2) don't delete old phase 1 information, even if we get INITIAL-CONTACT
       message..
   (3) don't delete phase 1 information, if it is very new.  delete phase 1
       information only if they are old.
   (4) implement tie-breaker rule.  for example, compare IP address and remove
       phase 1 initiated by the one who has larger IP address.

Q: IPv6 neighbor discovery.
	When a security policy is set to "all packet require IPsec", it will
	cover IPv6 ND packets as well.  The node will try to secure ND, and
	we will have chicken-and-egg problem (without ND we cannot send IKE
	packets, without IKE negotiation we cannot send ND).

	What can we do?
	- always bypass IPsec policy lookup if a packet is for ND.
	- Security policy should have more detail rules to filter
	  such packet, like icmp6 type/code filters.

Q: When there are no ID payloads in phase 2 ?
	Guess from the pair of address of IKE peer.

Q: Which SPI should I carry on Delete notify ?
	There is no documentation.

	An initiator should send a set of SPI of inbound SAs.
	A responder should delete a set of outbound SAs which are sent by
	an initiator.

	When an IKE node deletes old SAs, it will send DELETE notify to
	a peer.

	When does a node send DELETE notify ?
		when a IKE node deletes old SAs expilicitly.
		when a SA expires (hard lifetime reached).
			It may not be necessary.

	When a DELETE notify packet is dropped, SA will get inconsistent
	between peers.
		We can prevent from it by using "heartbeat".

Q: "heartbeat"
	It means a signal of "I'm alive".
	It is exchanged in phase 1.5.
	When a responder dies/reboots, we can know it by using "heartbeat".
	Is INITIAL-CONTACT message useless ?
		We don't know.

Q: responder's action in a normal case.
	A responder should never initiate both phase 1 and phase 2 at anytime.
	Once we have decided which side we are (initiator/responder), the
	relationship will never change.  (sakane)

	On phase 1, it is good for a responder not to initiate. (watanabe)

Q: only the byte type of lifetime on phase 2, not exist the type of time.
	No ducumentation states explicitly.
	We can choose to use default lifetime (28800).
	We can reject it accortding to a policy.

Q: lifetime negotiation
	what should we do if we got lifetime value that does not match our
	policy?
	- reject it
	- RESPONDER LIFETIME
	- during negotiation obey the initiator.  install SA lifetime based
	  on the lifetime we have decided (not from the negotiation).

Q: responder should not modify phase 2 attributes
	even for phase 1, we should not modify attributes.
	for lifetime attributes, it is okay to switch between V/B format.

	draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-01.txt Appendix A:
	If this is the case, an
	attribute offered as variable (or basic) by the initiator of this
	protocol MAY be returned to the initiator as a basic (or variable).

Q: check if reserved field is zero, reject if

    o  Certificate Authority (variable length) - Contains an encoding of
       an acceptable certificate authority for the type of certificate
       requested.  As an example, for an X.509 certificate this field
       would contain the Distinguished Name encoding of the Issuer Name
       of an X.509 certificate authority acceptable to the sender of
       this payload.  This would be included to assist the responder in
       determining how much of the certificate chain would need to be
       sent in response to this request.  If there is no specific
       certificate authority requested, this field SHOULD not be
       included.
