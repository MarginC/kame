HOW DO I DO ?
o ID payload handling in phase 2 besides IPSECDOI_ID_IP*.
  e.g. IPSECDOI_ID_DER_ASN1_DN.  Well, are these used in phase 2 ?
o What should I do when HARD expiration has come ?
o When node has multi address, I check only destination address on phase 2.
	Must be check both with src and dst ?
o replay prevention
	limited number of session
	limited session per peer
	number of proposal
	....
o how to support multi interfaces ?
	connect to dummy, like ping6.
	bind multi address, like named.
  now is former.
o The padding for data attribute.
o vendorid's hash algorithm
	For aggressive mode ?.
	In mail mode, should I use negotiated algorithm ?
o encryption during aggressive mode.
	when receive encrypted packet of 1st exchange from responder,
	it can be decoded.  When we are responder, should we send encrypted ?
o packet padding ? in particular, variable attribute.
o What is the perpose of exchange of DH attribute on quick mode ?
o Should I do acceptable check of phase 2 pfs group ?.
  If initiator requests PFS, should we accept without acceptable check.
o base mode
   3.1. Base Mode Authenticated with Signatures
   HDR, SA, Idii, Ni_b     =>
                  Ni ???
                           <= HDR, SA, Idir, Nr_b
                                             Nr ?
o What's proto_id in notify message of responder 2nd message with commit bit
  processing when multiple different SA applyed ?
o Is it forbidden to clear commit bit during phase2 negotiation ?
o how many time is the notify message sent ?
