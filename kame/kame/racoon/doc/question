HOW DO I DO ?
Q. ID payload handling in phase 2 besides IPSECDOI_ID_IP*.
   e.g. IPSECDOI_ID_DER_ASN1_DN.  Well, are these used in phase 2 ?
Q. What should I do when HARD expiration has come ?
Q. When node has multi address, I check only destination address on phase 2.
	Must be check both with src and dst ?
Q. replay prevention
	limited number of session
	limited session per peer
	number of proposal
	....
Q. how to support multi interfaces ?
	connect to dummy, like ping6.
	bind multi address, like named.
   now is former.
Q. The padding for data attribute.
Q. vendorid's hash algorithm
	For aggressive mode ?.
	In mail mode, should I use negotiated algorithm ?
Q. encryption during aggressive mode.
	when receive encrypted packet of 1st exchange from responder,
	it can be decoded.  When we are responder, should we send encrypted ?
Q. packet padding ? in particular, variable attribute.
Q. What is the perpose of exchange of DH attribute on quick mode ?
Q. Should I do acceptable check of phase 2 pfs group ?.
   If initiator requests PFS, should we accept without acceptable check.
Q. base mode
   3.1. Base Mode Authenticated with Signatures
   HDR, SA, Idii, Ni_b     =>
                  Ni ???
                           <= HDR, SA, Idir, Nr_b
                                             Nr ?
Q. What's proto_id in notify message of responder 2nd message with commit bit
  processing when multiple different SA applyed ?
Q. Is it forbidden to clear commit bit during phase2 negotiation ?

Q. how many time is the notify message sent ?
A. don't resend notify message because peer can use Acknowledged
   Informational if peer requires the reply of the notify message.
