.Sh NAME
.Nm dtcpc
.Nd Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol client
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dtcpc
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar if
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl r Ar routecommand
.Op Fl t Ar tuntype
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Ar server
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
implements Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol
.Pq DTCP for short
proposed by Trumpet.
.Nm
will first ask the DTCP password to the user.
Then, the program will try to connect DTCP server on
.Ar server ,
to IPv4 TCP port 20200
.Po
or port specified by
.Ar port
.Pc ,
login as DTCP client, and maintain IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel connection.
.Pp
The spec defines several kind of tunnel requests.
.Nm
will request tunnel typed
.Ar tuntype
to the DTCP server.
The default value for
.Ar tuntype
is
.Dq Li tunnelonly .
For tunnel types, please refer to
.Xr dtcps 8 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will use
.Li gif0
as tunnelling device.
This can be altered by using
.Fl i .
.Pp
.Fl r
specifies how the default route is configured.
If
.Dq Li static
is specified as
.Ar routecommand ,
.Nm
uses the
.Xr route 8
command to install the default route towards the corresponding
tunnel interface.
This is the default behavior.
If 
.Dq Li solicit
is specified,
.Nm
will call the
.Xr rtsol 8
command to send router solicitation messages toward the other
end of the tunnel.
.Pp
.Fl u
is needed when DTCP user account is different from
the login name on the host.
.Pp
.Fl d
puts
.Nm
into debug mode.
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
will exit with positive value on errors.
.\"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gif 4 ,
.Xr dtcps 8 ,
.Xr gifconfig 8
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
KAME kernel has some trouble handling
.Li /126
addresses.
To avoid trouble, please do not use
.Dq Fl t Li host
for the moment.
This should be fixed soon.
.Pp
.Nm
will not work if you are behind a NAT box
.Po
This is a protocol feature, not a bug
.Pc .
