.Nd A Simple Movement Detector for Mobile IPv6 and Network Mobility 
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl p Ar interval
.Op Fl h Ar mipinterface
.Op  interfaces
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon to detect movement of a mobile node and a mobile router of SHISA.
.Nm
is the simplest version of movement detector and does not have enhanced features at all.
That's why we call it baby ;-). 
.Pp
You have to use 
.Nm
with either 
.Xr mnd 8
or
.Xr mrd 8
daemons.
If you need special enhancements for movement detection to enable fast
handover, etc., you can always creates a new movement detector and use it
instead of 
.Nm .
.Nm 
can be used as a sample program of movement detecters.
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl h Ar mip interface
Spefify Mobile IPv6 pseudo interface such as mip0.
A home address is taken from attched this interface.
.It Fl d
Output debug messages to 
.Xr syslogd 8
.It Fl D
Output more verbose debug messages to 
.Xr syslogd 8
.It Fl p Ar interval
Specify a polling interval to watch link status information.
Note that the link status information is not available for all the interfaces on your machine.
.It interfaces
Specify interfaces with which you want to attach your mobile node to the Internet. 
If no interface is specified, 
.Nm
will watch all the available interfaces.
.El
.Pp
Upon receipt of SIGHUP, 
.Nm
will reissue a movement message even if an actual movement hadn't occured.
This would be useful when 
.Xr mnd 8
had restarted and it needs to get a movement information as an initial condition.
