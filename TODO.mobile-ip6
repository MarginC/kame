TODOs for mobile-ip6
KAME project
$KAME: TODO.mobile-ip6,v 1.10 2000/07/26 08:07:08 itojun Exp $


- Indentation.  mip6*.c is not consistent even within a files.  At least
  rule should be consistent across the file.
- KLD support for platforms that support it.
- Test.
- relationship with IPsec.
- there's no vprintf() in kernel for bsdi[34].  (sys/netinet6/mip6.c)

done:
- ioctl should use error code declared in sys/errno.h, not others.
- "struct input_data" in mip6_common.h is way too generic name and
  I've changed it into mip6_input_data.
- function prototypes with __P().
- rtadvd needs to preserve non-mobileip6 behavior so I added a command
  line option (-m).
- tcpdump can use netinet6/mip6.h decls so I've used them.
  may need to back out the change or integrate part of mip6.h into
  print-{icmp6,ip6opts}.c when we integrate the change into
  tcpdump.org tree.
- portability fixes for non-freebsd3.
- Nuke in6_control() calls from within the kernel.
- Remove MIP6_MN and MIP6_HA #ifdef.  Too many #ifdef will kill us, and it is
  painful to reconfigure kernel every time we switch the operation.  ioctl
  or sysctl should switch the behavior (it is okay to have one-way switch:
  if can require reboot to go back to normal stationary node).
- Make routing table/inpcb refresh code portable.  Use of in6_rtchange with
  rnh->rnh_walktree is suggested.
- make use of encap6_attach(), instead of gif interface.
